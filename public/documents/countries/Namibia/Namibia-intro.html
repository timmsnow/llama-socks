    Namibia. Land of the desert and star-filled skies. Vast, wild, and staggeringly beautiful, it’s a country so diverse
    and expansive that it can feel like a continent unto itself. The entire country is a like a movie, an ever-changing
    display of unbridled wilderness. Here, you could drop your camera, accidentally take a photo, and sell it to
    National Geographic. The towering sand dunes of the Namib, the scorching red earth of the Kalahari, the exquisite
    white expanse of the Etosha pan: Namibia is nature’s playground.

    The wildlife here is of a hearty stock, and despite harsh conditions, maintains thriving numbers. Exploring the
    interior of the country guarantees you a personal experience with a wildly dynamic environment. Here you can camp in
    the wilderness and sleep under the brilliant star-filled blanket of a cloudless south African sky. Self-drive your
    way on your own safari through the many exceptional national parks, and get connected to a land with a ceaseless
    rhythm that’s entirely it’s own… the heartbeat of the oldest desert in the world.

    There is nowhere on Earth like Namibia, and a visit here ensures a buffet of incomparable, stirring vistas, up-close
    wildlife encounters, and a lifetime of longing to come back.
