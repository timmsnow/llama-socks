    My first trip to Thailand was in 2005. It was a simpler time. Before the selfie, and the instagram, before airbnb,
    and Uber, and all the things that have made the world so completely accessible and digestible to the western
    sensibilities. Of course when I was there I was traveling with someone who had been there in the 90’s. “THOSE were
    the good old days of Thailand”, he had explained. “In the 90’s it was all pristine! Just a few hippies and beach
    huts. None of this gap year backpacker spring break party nonsense! …a man could eat his pad thai in peace!” ….But
    then, of course, a man sitting one table away from us corrected him saying, “The 90’s were PACKED with tourists,
    that’s when it all went downhill! The 80’s! THAT was the best time to be in Thailand!”.

    Change is the inevitable monster that haunts the dreams of travelers who stumble onto the perfect place at the
    perfect time. But the truth is, while Thailand’s popularity has changed the nature of tourism in the country, it’s
    an extremely resilient place. Despite the onslaught of the fully-loaded, I-phone wielding, instagramming hordes
    descending en masse and tweeting their way across the country, Thai people remain welcoming and friendly. The coast
    line is as breath-taking as it ever was, and even though you might have to work a little harder for it, there are
    still some pretty incredible hidden gems tucked safely away from the less intrepid hordes of wanna-be youtube
    celebrities.

    This is a country that leaves an impact. There’s nowhere else on the planet that gives what Thailand gives, and she
    dishes it out in spades. The fact remains that no matter how old you are, or which decade you visit, you are always
    in the right place, at the right time in Thailand. I’ve been back 3 times since my first trip in 2005, and I’ll
    continue to visit until the day I die. If I could go every year, I would, if only to eat my face off.

    This is a place that never gets old. Where your senses are heightened, challenged, and revived. You can wax poetic
    about the “old days”, but the truth remains, no matter how much you’ve seen or how long you’ve stayed, there is
    always more to be discovered in Thailand.
