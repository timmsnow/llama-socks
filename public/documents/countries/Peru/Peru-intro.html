  <p>…Where to even begin?</p>
  <p>
    Peru is one of those countries that you _think_ you know what to expect, but then you get there and… it’s just so
    much more than you ever could have dreamed. Geographically vast and geologically diverse, Peru puts on a real show,
    and it’s guaranteed to awe and impress even the most jaded of travelers.

    This is the country of the Inca, the Moche, the Chachapoya, and the Norte Chico. Thousands of years of cultural
    sophistication and artistic expression deeply color the historical record of Peru, and every day we learn a little
    more about the people who lived, built, and thrived there.

  <p>There is so much more to Peru than Machu Picchu.</p>
  <p>
    From the Amazon, to the deserts of Nazca, from the Sacred Valley to the deep cut canyons of Arequipa, Peru is not a
    country you want to rush through. Around ever corner lies a human, animal, or geologic anomaly just begging to be
    explored, researched, and documented. This is a country where you will see, hear, feel, and taste an energy that
    can’t be found anywhere else on the planet… oh and did I mention the ceviche? Because it’s insane. The ceviche, is
    for real. INSANE!
