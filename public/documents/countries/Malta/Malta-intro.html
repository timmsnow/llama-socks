    The tiny island group of Malta has been the fulcrum on which the Mediterranean world has pivoted for most of
    recorded history. The peoples of Europe, Africa, and Asia have, time and again, converged on this tiny rocky
    outcrop, intent on setting a new course for our civilizational evolution. Warfare, politics and the religions of the
    world have all hinged on which winds blew which ships across Malta’s craggy shores.

    Some of the humanity’s oldest standing monuments are found on Malta, with evidence of early settlements going back
    to the Neolithic era. These little islands, alone in the middle of a vast sea, served as a weigh station for ancient
    settlers, and Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Greeks, and Romans have all left an indelible mark here. Homer wrote about
    Malta in The Odyssey, as the mythical home of Calypso, the enchantress, and the final resting place of many an
    ancient shipwreck.

    Famously, St Paul is said to have crash-landed on Malta, and he didn’t waste any time before proselytizing and
    converting the confused Roman populace. As soon as Islam came onto the scene, the island became locked in a
    tug-of-war between these two dominate religions, until 1565, when the Siege of Malta ended the dispute and put the
    islands firmly under Christian control. Since then the islands have continued to live somewhere in-between Africa
    and Europe, on a plane of existence all it’s own. It’s this blending of culture that gives the Maltese people their
    unique national character, an identity forged over thousands of years, and defined by their place at the crossroads
    of the world.
