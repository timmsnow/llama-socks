    There is an art to backpacking Indonesia Because Indonesia isn’t just a country, it’s a world unto itself. There are
    over 17,000 islands in the archipelago and over 300 different native languages spoken. While the country itself is a
    majority muslim nation, the islands are extremely culturally diverse with Hinduism, Christianity, Buddhism, and
    Confucianism all having a strong presence in different pockets of the country.

    The island of Java is the commercial hub, with well over half of the 264 million people that make up the population
    residing there. The islands of Sumatra, Borneo, and Sulawesi are natural wonderlands with incredibly diverse
    eco-systems, although all of them are currently under threat. Islands like Lombok and Bali tend to get most of the
    attention from foreign tourists, and developers are always on the look-out for the next big beach destination.

    Prepare your senses for a battle royale. Your taste buds will be turned up to 10 navigating the culinary repertoire
    that gave credence to the nick-name “the spice islands” and you’ll be seeing a depth in colors you never knew could
    exist in nature. You’ve arrived, on these islands, you will find paradise.
