    Few places in the world are as geographically and geologically blessed as the country of Italy. Highly volcanic and
    mineral rich, the soil here is some of the most nutrient-filled and agriculturally viable in the world, a veritable
    arboretum for the seeds of human culture to take root.

    For centuries Celts, Greeks, Phoenicians, Carthaginians, and Etruscans all reaped the rewards of Italy’s central
    location on the Mediterranean sea, the superhighway of the ancient world. Late Bronze Age Phoenicians set up posts
    along coasts, kicking off an era of unprecedented sea trade. The great, temple-building Greeks constructed mammoth
    architectural works and asserted a cultural dominance equal in size and influence to the one on the Grecian
    mainland. The Etruscans established themselves under the Tuscan sun (ha!) as the dominate force in central Italy,
    ushering in a cultural renaissance the likes of which had never before existed in Europe.

    And then of course, the world saw the rise of Rome. That scrappy little republic that rose out of the swamp to
    become the unquestioned master of the western world. Roman art, Roman industry, and Roman ideology transformed the
    ancient world irrevocably. It is the Roman force of will that has conveyed the Latin identity through the annals of
    history.

    Modern Italy is literally covered with the monuments of its forebears, and every step on the long march to the 21st
    century must involve a reckoning with the past. Things move slower in Italy than in other European neighbors, and
    both business and public works projects are often stalled, or abandoned all together due to the discovery of this or
    that archeological treasure buried below.

    The Italian way is a haphazard one, with its leaning towers and its rumbling volcanoes, and Italians, by and large,
    are animated and passionate. They are devout admirers of beauty, and understand how to find joy in the inherent
    chaos of life. Nowhere in the world are a people more dedicated to the craft of cooking (and eating), and more sure
    of the quality of their product.

    Italy is infectious, and despite its enormity, and its vast regional diversity, nothing here feels foreign for long.
    In every corner of the country you’ll find exceptional food, spirited people, and unrelenting natural beauty. Ready
    your eager heart, this is a land that invites you to indulge, and wastes no time heaping it on the plate.
