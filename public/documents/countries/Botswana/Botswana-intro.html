    Botswana is one of those quintessential “Trip of a Lifetime” destinations that seems almost inaccessible to anyone
    who hasn’t made the Forbes top 100. But the truth is a little more nuanced than that. It’s true that the majority of
    the tourism industry here is geared to the wealthy, with prohibitively expensive luxury lodges and package tours,
    but that doesn’t mean it can’t be done on a budget. Traveling independently in Botswana can be done for a reasonable
    cost without missing out on the immersive African experience that drives the 1% to holiday here in droves.

    Roughly 80% of this country is barren, sandy, dry, Kalahari desert, and life in the driest months ain’t easy for the
    animals that spend their lives here. What makes Botswana so unique is the yearly flooding of the Okavango Delta in
    the northern stretch of the country. While the rest of the country bakes in an unforgiving sun, the life-giving
    flood waters make their way down from Angola to create a lush, marshy, nutrient-rich water world for all the fauna
    to … well.. faun over. The Delta holds water year round, but during the flood season, the waters fill previously dry
    riverbeds creating essential life-lines for herds of animals who depend on the seasonal arteries to survive. It is
    this incredible flooding that allows Botswana to provide a safe and abundant environment for some of the largest
    numbers of African game on the continent.

    While animal life is copious, outside of the cities, the human population is relatively small and much of the
    country has been designated as National Reserve. This means as much as 30% of the entire country is protected under
    what are perhaps the strongest environmental laws in all of Africa.

    Renting a 4×4 and camping your way across this vast, natural wonder is something you can never forget. Imagine
    waking up to a magnificent sunrise under gigantic, open skies, scouring the scrubland for rhinos, elephants, and
    giraffes, and falling asleep to the distant (or not so distant) yet unmistakeable sound of roaring lions. THIS is
    Africa, and that’s exactly what Botswana is all about.
