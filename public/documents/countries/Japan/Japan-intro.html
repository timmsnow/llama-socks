    Now, I don’t typically like to play favorites… but Japan is ABSOLUTELY one of my favorite countries in the world. I
    waited for years to feel the call from the land of the rising sun, waiting for just the right moment when I would
    have the right budget, enough time, and the appropriate appetite for the richness that oozes from every corner of
    the country. It’s a land where the mountains meet the sea and the past meets the future.

    Aesthetics, discipline, and a true reverence for the natural world come together to create a culture so unique and
    enticing, it’s addictive. Come prepared for greatness, and get ready to eat your face off. Meshiagare!
