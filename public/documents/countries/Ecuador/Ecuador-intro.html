    When you find it on a map, Ecuador, at first, seems small, especially when compared with its giant South American
    neighbors like Peru, Colombia, and Brazil. Ecuador, which covers about .2% of the world’s surface area is roughly
    the same size as the state of Arizona. But small doesn’t always mean monochrome, and Ecuador is anything but a
    one-trick pony.

    Ecuador is an incredibly rich and diverse country, with multiple eco-systems housing approximately 10% of the
    biodiversity of the entire planet. That means 8% of all amphibian species can be found in Ecuador, as well as 8% of
    all mammals, and 16% of all bird species. Their homes range from rainforests to mangroves, cloud forests, to
    tropical dry forests.

    And then of course, there are the Galapagos Islands. The Galapagos are like a dream wrapped up in a fairy tale
    dipped in science fiction and dripping with wizardry. It’s a place unlike anywhere else on the planet, where humans
    get a rare opportunity to see what the world might look like, if we never existed at all.
