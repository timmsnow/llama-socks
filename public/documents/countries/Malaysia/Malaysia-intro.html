    When most people think about Malaysia, it’s the sky-scraping Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur that come to mind, or
    the pungent seafood Laksa emanating from the street vendors in GeorgeTown, Penang. This is peninsular Malaysia, the
    beautiful hunk of limestone-karst-covered land that stretches down from southern Thailand, with the Andaman Sea to
    the west and the Gulf of Thailand to the East, a modern, fast paced, multi-cultural melting pot brimming with a
    populace ready to make their mark on the world.

    But Malaysia is geographically split into two parts. The peninsula is sky-rocketing into the 21st century mostly in
    thanks to Malaysia’s greatest natural asset, lying just across the South China Sea: wild and enigmatic Borneo. It’s
    the third largest island in the world, and the largest on the continent of Asia. A land so full of natural
    resources, over-eager corporations, with the help of an economic-growth-driven government, tirelessly seek out new
    ways to dominate and exploit this dense and dynamic wonderland. The wildlife endemic to Borneo doesn’t exist
    anywhere else in the world, and every day their habitat shrinks by a wider margin. Borneo’s story is one of loss and
    consequence. Despite new efforts to ward off encroachment, it continues to be a losing battle between Borneo’s
    wildlife and their biggest enemy: the Palm oil Plantation.

    Malaysia’s strengths come from it’s natural beauty, the rich, multi-cultural blend of it’s people, and it’s drive to
    defy the odds and position itself as a powerhouse in a world where the cards are often stacked against them.
    Malaysia is all these things, so prepare to be rocked, and get ready to gorge on some of the best damn street food
    in all of Asia.
