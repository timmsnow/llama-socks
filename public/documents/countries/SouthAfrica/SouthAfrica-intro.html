    South Africa is a land of wild extremes. While perhaps best known around the world for its volatile past and the
    brutal injustices of apartheid, these days the self-proclaimed rainbow nation is striving to be a beacon of hope at
    the southern tip of an often unpredictable continent. While things are reasonably settled and day to day life moves
    along in South Africa, racial tensions and income inequality continue to cast a dark shadow across the new nation
    that was only so recently re-born and rebranded as a land for all people.

    The people here are a melting pot of Zulu, Xhosa, Indian, Malay, and white people of English/Dutch descent, among
    others, and all of them are learning how to navigate the brave new world that really only began less than 40 years
    ago. With that in mind, the country has made staggering progress.

    To say it’s a beautiful country is like saying the ocean is a “little wet”, or the universe is a “big place”. South
    Africa’s impossibly green, jagged mountain peaks lead down to verdant hills that eventually tumble into the vast
    expanse of the southern oceans. The wildlife in the national parks come in droves, and the seasons here turn
    regularly, unlike the majority of the rest of the continent. With so much diversity to take in, you’ll want to do
    yourself a favor, and plan for a longer trip.
