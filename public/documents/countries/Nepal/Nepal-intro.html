    There is a palpable vibration in Nepal that is impossible to miss. Navigating the dusty streets of Kathmandu you
    canâ€™t help but feel as though you have been transported to a corner of the world long tucked away and forgotten.
    Even though modernity has descended upon the cities of this highland country, the giant shadow of the Himalayas
    dominates the landscape. The air up here is thin and clean.

    To enter Nepal is to enter the territory of the divine, a heavenly Shangri-La, where buddhist prayer flags flutter
    in the high-altitude winds and all around you the ancient glaciers hum the collective OHM of timelessness.
