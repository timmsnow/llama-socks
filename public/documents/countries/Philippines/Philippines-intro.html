    Oh land of constant contradiction. The Philippines is like the prettiest girl in the whole school. She makes you
    feel like you’re the only one who matters. She fills your head with compliments, braids your hair at slumber
    parties, holds your hand when you’re sad, tells you really funny jokes, and then she has ONE wine cooler and barfs
    up all over you JUST before you get to the spring dance? So. Very. RUDE.

    And that’s our girl the Philippines. She’s sweet and inviting, and she’ll kick you in the guts the second you drop
    your guard.

    With over 7,000 islands and islets and hidden coves and caves and reefs and volcanoes this hunk of rock is
    seriously, exhaustingly, gorgeous. No matter how much time you end up dedicating to the Philippines (and you WILL
    need time if you want to see even a smidgen of the bounty thats on offer here), you’re never going to grasp it all.
    The Philippines is a nation made of unbelievable, rugged coastlines, misty volcanic mountaintops, and home to an
    unparalleled underwater paradise. There is a strength in the people here that was cultivated through ancient
    ingenuity, a refusal to give up, and by harnessing that most powerful and dangerous weapon of them all… the god damn
    personal karaoke machine.

    To travel deep here isn’t easy, and it can wear you down. But you know, it is how they say, just like the
    Philippines herself, sometimes you gotta get knocked down in order to get built back up.
