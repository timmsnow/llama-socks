  <p>Tanzania. Wild, beautiful, and unquestionably African.</p>
  <p>
    This is big sky country. In fact, it’s big sky, big tree, big mountain, and big ANIMAL country. Everything here
    feels monumental. Giant Kilimanjaro stands tall against the sky while underneath, herding elephants and wildebeest
    plod their way through the grassy savannah. Tanzania is a land of drama.
  </p>
  <p>
    A million stories are told here every day, the life and death struggles of nature’s wildest and mightiest played out
    on the grand stage of this untamable continent.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is the land where the animal kingdom and humanity meet, clumsily, sometimes even violently, and it’s the laws
    of nature here, not those of mankind, that ultimately rule the day.
