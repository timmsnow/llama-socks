    The Cambodian story is one of ancient imperial splendor, colonial oppression, country wide devastation, human
    resilience, and continuous rebirth. Known to be one of the most bombed countries in the world thanks to the
    excessive and indiscriminate use of the US bombers during the “Vietnam War”, Cambodia is no stranger to destruction.

    With the ending of the war came the rise of the Khmer Rouge and 4 years of brutal mass killings that claimed the
    lives of up to two million Cambodian citizens. The 20th century as a whole has not been a kind one and even now the
    people of Cambodia are subject to poverty, hunger, government corruption, and a weak infrastructure, a testament to
    the legacy left behind after a century of hardship.

    That being said Cambodians continue to be welcoming to foreigners, whether we deserve it or not, and a steady flow
    of tourist dollars into the economy is slowly but surely improving conditions in areas of the country that need it
    badly.

    The most famous site in the country, Angkor Archeological Park, is a breath-taking example of the grandeur that the
    innovative builders of the ancient Khmer people achieved during their tenure as THE preeminent South East Asian
    power. The site is a testament to the might and creativity of a people who’s resiliency continues to carry them
    through crisis after crisis. It’s a powerful place, and one hell of a spokesmodel for a country that will leave you
    impressed, humbled, and hopefully, a little more self-aware than when you arrived.
