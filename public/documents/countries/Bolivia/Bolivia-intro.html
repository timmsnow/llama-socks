    Sandwiched in-between South American heavy-hitters like Argentina, Chile, and Peru, mountainous, land-locked Bolivia
    rarely gets the kind of attention awarded to its more famous next-door neighbors. That’s a shame, because Bolivia
    has a landscape as wide and varied as any, and maintains a strong cultural and historical legacy that’s unmatched
    anywhere else on the continent.

    For many Bolivians, daily life is defined by the thin air of the “Altiplano”, a vast Andean plateau, which sits at
    between 4,000-5000 meters above sea level. Covering approximately 40,000 square miles, this is the world’s most
    extensive plateau outside of Tibet. The inherent isolation that the high altitude provides has allowed Bolivia to
    retain much of its extraordinarily diverse cultural identity, with 60% of the population being of Native American
    ancestry.

    Bolivia is where the Amazon meets the Andes. It’s the home of the largest salt flats in the world, and where a
    seemingly boundless plateau extends itself toward an ample horizon, before tumbling down to the driest place on
    Earth: the Atacama Desert.
