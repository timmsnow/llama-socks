    "texts": ["Bolivia has a surprising number of operational, well-linked train lines that connect some key points of interest around the country. In some parts of the country, where the roads are seasonally degraded to the point of near-impassability, taking the train is the preferable form of transportation in Bolivia.","The only real downside to train travel in Bolivia is that the services aren’t as frequent as one might want, with some routes only operating a couple times a week, and seats call sell out pretty quickly. While you may be able to show up and snag a seat on the day of, it’s better to play it safe and book a few days in advance, either by calling or making a stop at the ticket offices in town.","One of the more beautiful, and highly recommended train routes is the Oruro-Villazon route, which passes through some epic Andean scenery, including a not-completely dried up lake bed. This route stops in Uyuni, for those wanting to check out the salt flats, and several train lines operate on different days.\n\nIf you are interested in making the trip to Uyuni by train, check out the website for The FCA (Empresa Ferroviaria Andina S.A.) for an updated timetable and prices. If you are coming from La Paz, note that you will need to take a bus to Oruro (approx 3-4 hours) first to catch the train."]

    "texts": ["The two major international airports where you’re most likely to enter Bolivia are La Paz in the west and Santa Cruz in the East. The airport servicing La Paz is actually situated on a high plateau just outside of the city in a town called “El Alto” and, at just over 4,000 meters above sea level, is considered the highest altitude airport in the world, meaning flying in can be something of a shock to your system if you are not used to being at high altitudes. The lower lying areas of La Paz are in the 3,000 meter range, so if you’re feeling a little off when you first arrive, things should ease up a bit when you head down into the city valley.","Because of it’s high altitude, there are some additional costs involved with landing in the La Paz airport and so it’s often cheaper to fly into Santa Cruz. However, Santa Cruz is on the other side of the country and not close at all to La Paz, and this option should only be explored if you are planning on visiting eastern regions of the country.","Taxis in La Paz are easy to find at the airport, and should cost you around $10 USD to get to the center. It can take anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour+ depending on traffic and road conditions. Make sure you agree on a price before you get in the taxi, as otherwise you will most assuredly end up in an argument with the driver.","There is a public bus available that ferries passengers directly from the airport to the main bus station in central La Paz. The cost is approximately $1 USD, but again, ask the driver before boarding for confirmation and peace of mind. From the central bus station you should be able to grab a cheap taxi or walk to your destination.","Air transportation in Bolivia can be essential if you’re traveling long distances. Because Bolivia’s roads are not always in the best of conditions (only 5% are paved), choosing to fly, particularly the longer stretches of travel on your itinerary, is not a bad way to go. There are numerous domestic airlines and most flights are pretty reasonably priced. The regional flights fill up quicker than the inter-city flights, so book ahead when you can."]

    "texts": ["When it comes to local transportation in Bolivia, there are four specific types of taxis, and they all have their uses.", "You’ll hear a lot of people recommending the use of “RadioTaxi’s” for tourists while in Bolivia. These are the taxis that exist under officially registered taxi companies. They will be the most “official” looking of the taxi services and will be clearly identifiable, with company logo clearly displayed, a phone-number, and most likely a placard in the windshield. Because these taxis work with a centralized company, and the majority of their fares are dispatched, rather than picked up on the side of the street, every ride is tracked, with your destination point logged by the dispatcher, making criminal activity unlikely. Radio-taxis are by far considered to be the safest of the taxi’s in Bolivia. While it is possible to hail them on the street, calling the company in advance and having them pick you up ensures that everyone involved knowns where you began, and where you will end your trip. Radio Taxi’s also have set rates, and typically use the meter, but it’s always good to double check before you get in.", "Taxi Particulares are a wonderfully Bolivian enterprise, and operate essentially like UBER does, but without the internet. These are private cars, unmarked and unaffiliated with any company. The drivers could be university students, or someone just looking to make a little extra money on their day off. Typically they will have some sort of handmade sign with the word “TAXI” posted on their windshield, and pick up passengers on the street in need of a lift. Taxi Particulares can be cheap, friendly, and effective ways of getting around town, but there is, of course some risk involved. These taxis are not regulated AT ALL. You are really putting your life in the hands of a random stranger.", "The Trufi is a fixed route taxi. It essentially serves the same purpose as a city bus, except that it’s much smaller, generally more cramped, and very very cheap. Trufi’s have little flags over their headlights to help you identify them, and are often color coded to correspond with their route, which never changes, unless there is a road-block or some other traffic interruption.", "Lastly, UBER has come to Bolivia. This can work out for a traveler great, since it’s quick, cheap, and easy, however a lot of tourists have a hard time synching their phones to the Bolivian mobile system, which may mean you can only use the app while connected to wifi, but these days, that isn’t too hard to find in the cities."]

    "texts": ["Ahhh the great joys of Bolivian bus travel. Now, I’ll be honest, the buses I took in Bolivia were not the worst I’ve taken by a long stretch, but bus transportation in Bolivia is not without its idiosyncrasies. If you’re in Bolivia after traveling in Peru, it can be hard to grade them on a fair scale, since those Peruvian buses are so damn fine.", "Like a lot of South American bus stations, those in Bolivia tend to be chaotic. There are a ton of different bus companies operating out of the same station and they all employ the same hawker-seller strategy for getting passengers. Most of the hawkers are friendly enough though and if you tell them where you want to go they will likely point you in the right direction. No matter anyway since all of the routes are listed by the different companies outside of the ticket windows.", "Note that you will need to pay the “bus station departure tax” before your bus leaves. There is generally a small booth, where you pay a very nominal fee, and receive a ticket that you can staple to your bus ticket. This is to show you have paid your taxes, and then you can be on your way.", "While there are some VIP buses, known as “cama” buses, or “bed-buses” with reclining seats, don’t expect the same level of comfort as you found in Peru, Chile, or Argentina. The majority of the buses are pretty worn down, and even if they have a toilet on-board, chances are it’s going to be locked, or re-purposed by the bus driver as a storage unit.. either way: out of order.", "It’s not uncommon for the bus to make a few extra stops to pick up passengers along the side of the highway, and the aisle and stairs of the buses can quickly become full of commuting families. Just be glad you have a seat.", "Only 5% of the roads in Bolivia are paved, meaning you could be in for some bumpy rides if bus is your primary mode of transit. That being said some of the major highways connecting the big cities are paved, at least most of the way, so intercity travel is a little bit more organized than more rural, regional travel.", "Bolivia is a very politically active country, and protests are a regular occurrence that often results in road blocks. These can last several days and disrupt bus travel across the country. While _somewhat_ unpredictable, it may be wise to check before you buy your tickets to see if something is going on that could interrupt your trip, and plan appropriately.", "Generally speaking, the larger bus companies provide the best service. If you’re riding in a larger coach, your luggage will be tagged and stored in the compartments below the bus. You’ll be given a tag as a reassurance that your bags will still be there when you get off. You’ll show the ticket at the end and get your bag back. HOORAY."]
