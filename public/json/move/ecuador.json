    "texts": ["Quito and Guayaquil are the two international ports of entry into Ecuador. Both airports are modern and located on the outskirts of their respective city. There is a departure tax included in the ticket cost should you be leaving Ecuador via plane.", "The main airlines serving Ecuador’s domestic flights are Avianca, Latam, and Tame. In terms of mainland travel, flights are cheap and quick, rarely topping $120. Given Ecuador’s size, it’s safe to assume that a domestic flight won’t last longer than 45 minutes to an hour. Like most airlines in South America, it is generally cheaper to book flights once you are already in the country as opposed to booking them from your home country. That being said, you will want to read the fine print closely on the local websites as there is sometimes an additional cost associated with tickets for foreigners. To avoid confusion you can also book your tickets in person with an airline agent when you arrive.", "Flights to the Galapagos leave from Quito or Guayaquil and arrive at Baltra or San Cristobal airport depending on which island you are planning to base yourself. Baltra airport is about an hours drive from the city center of Puerto Ayora, while San Cristobal airport is a five minute drive from town. It’s about a 2 hour flight from Guayaquil. Be prepared for an extensive screening of all your luggage upon arrival."]

    "texts": ["Driving in Ecuador is on the right hand side of the road.", "You need to be at least 25 years of age and have a valid drivers license in order to rent a car. Pretty much all cars here are manual, so if you aren’t comfortable driving a stick, forget it, and there are a few other things to keep in mind before you commit to driving in Ecuador.", "Firstly, you will only want to drive during the day. Visibility in the highlands isn’t great at the best of times due to mist and blind corners, at night it’s even worse. While the main highways have recently been given a facelift, the vast majority of the rural roads are not in great condition. The majority of the roads in Ecuador do not have guard rails, even in the mountains. You would think that this would encourage drivers to be more cautious, but don’t count on it. Drivers in Ecuador are known for being a bit reckless when it comes to overtaking on blind corners. There are a lot of opportunities to get into a bad accident here.", "Always travel with a jack, spare tire, and a working cell phone. If you find yourself in a remote area there may not be anyone around to help immediately.", "While car-jackings aren’t _super_ common, they do happen. If you are going to drive make sure you plan your route accordingly, in advance so you know which towns and neighborhoods you’ll be driving through.", "Accident resolution can be something of a shit show in Ecuador. For starters, the police have a reputation for being less than helpful to foreigners. The less you interact with them behind the wheel, the better. In addition, locals may not be in a hurry to claim responsibility for an accident given the assumption that you, as a foreigner, has the money to pay for any damages. If there is no clear agreement on who is at fault, both parties may be taken int police custody until the matter is resolved. If that sounds like fun to you, just wait til you get the bill from the rental agency. Many locals only want to handle matters directly rather than going through insurance, but it’s not advised to do anything without letting the rental agency know in advance.", "In Ecuador you can expect to pay a good bit for insurance coverage, and most rental agencies will place a $5000 hold on your credit card to guarantee payment in the case of damages or unpaid tickets.", "In my opinion, driving here is kind of a headache. You can get nearly everywhere you want to go without the hassle of baby-sitting a vehicle. I recommend the extremely cheap bus system. Maybe not as comfy, but a hell of a lot cheaper and without all the risks."]

    "texts": ["The bus system in Ecuador works pretty much like it does in other South American countries.", "In the main bus terminals in the larger cities different bus companies offer buses running on a _mostly_ predictable timetable. Since it can be difficult to find accurate timetables online, it can be a good idea to have a look at the timetables for your next destination upon arrival. It’s not a bad idea to get your tickets a day in advance if you’re choosy about departure times, especially in high season.", "Once you’re out of the big cities things can get a little less regular. Buses traveling up the coast or through the mountain towns tend to operate in minivans, at irregular (or less-dependable) intervals. These buses tend to leave when they are full, meaning if you’re picking it up halfway along the route you may find yourself spatially deprived, or even standing for part of the journey. The good news is that most routes are short, so any discomfort shouldn’t last too long.", "Keep your valuables with you at all times on the bus. Don’t place your bag underneath your seat or above your head as this can make the bags an easy target for opportunists. If you are keeping your bags in the luggage hold under the bus you should be ok, but keep your valuables with you.", "Unfortunately Ecuador doesn’t have the BEST safety record when it comes to mass transit. The biggest factor when it comes to bus accidents tends to be driver error (going too fast), or the age of the vehicle. If a bus looks particularly dilapidated, maybe opt out and jump on the next one. Avoid night buses, since most of the accidents happen at night.", "There are some alternative options for tourists. They are more expensive of course, but safe. EcuadorHop, for example sells multi-passes. I prefer the take-it-as-it-comes approach, but if you’re worried about bus safety, these buses are new and probably insured."]

This is sad, because generally speaking the vast majority of the taxi drivers I encountered in Ecuador were honest and kind people trying to make and honest buck to pay off their very high taxi registration fees. But it only takes a few bad apples right?", "In recent years the government has made great strides in trying to assure the safety of those traveling by taxi. State law requires all registered taxis to come equipped with security cameras, panic buttons, and GPS systems. Legally drivers are required to use the meter, however this rule only seems to really be followed in Quito, and even then you may need to gently remind the driver to turn the meter on.", "Official yellow cabs abound especially in the major cities and I recommend only making use of them, as opposed to unregistered and unofficial cabs. It’s not a bad idea to ask your hotel to call a cab for you, although you will most likely still need to negotiate the fare before you get in. Keep in mind that prices increase at night, though not by much.", "Guayaquil in particular has seen it’s fair share of issues with dishonest taxi drivers. It is recommended to only use radio-taxis when in Guayaquil. While you will more than likely be safe hailing an official yellow taxi, radio-taxis are guaranteed to be safe because they are tracked by the company themselves, which will ensure that you arrive safely at your pre-arranged destination. Apps like “EASY TAXI” will allow you to order a secure taxi through your phone. A picture of the driver and their vehicle will be sent to you once the ride is accepted."]
