    "texts": ["If you are flying internationally, it’s probably Cape Town International (CPT) or Johannesburg’s OR TAMBO (JNB) where you’ll be touching down.", "Because of JNB’s high altitude location, it means the airport has longer runways, and a lighter fuel load in order to take off safely in the thinner-than-normal air. For this reason a lot of long haul flights originating in Johannesburg will make re-fueling stops, while return flights can usually ply the whole route if taking off from a lower altitude airport. This can sometimes mean long flight times when going from South Africa to say… locations within the US or other destinations farther afield. It usually involves a longer layover somewhere in Europe, so it might be worth looking into a longer stopover if you find a connecting city you want to explore for a day or two.", "JNB is connected to the city as well as the domestic terminal by bus and rail lines. CPT has a bus shuttle connection to the bus station in the downtown civic center. Buses depart every 20 minutes from 04:20 to 22:00.", "South African Airways is the major carrier both domestically and internationally here. No complaints from me about South African.", "The rest of the country is well connected with domestic flights, including smaller airports like the ones around Kruger National Park. If you’re short on time this can significantly cut down your travel time."]

Particularly in areas where there is little in the way of public transit, or in high density areas like the Garden Route where there is so much to see and limited time to get everywhere.", "Always make sure to have a spare tire, and plan your routes through the well-lit, highly-trafficked areas in order to avoid the more dodgy road ways. It’s better to leave the driving for the day time, so plan your trips accordingly. Car jackings can happen in the cities, so again, know where you are driving and try to arrange your parking in advance.", "If you have any plans to go off the paved highways, drive through the desert, or self-drive through any of the national parks, do yourself a favor and rent a 4×4. Regular 2-wheel drive vehicles can create big problems for people trying to make it on their own in the bush.\n\nIf you’re driving through the desert, bring extra supplies like food, water, and gasoline. Mark service stations along your route where possible.", "Self drive safaris are absolutely doable in a lot of the nature reserves and national parks of South Africa. It can be exhilarating to manage your own safari. Just make sure you adhere to the park rules and drive carefully and with respect for the wildlife here. Animals don’t love the cars creeping up on them, so keep an appropriate distance."]

    "texts": ["If you don’t have a car and are trying explore outside of the cities, it can be difficult to get around. Hitch-hiking in Africa is an extremely common practice among the locals. If you see a group of people on the side of the road, you can join in the queue (yes, the best pickup spots have a queue!). One by one passing cars will scoop up whoever’s going their way and eventually it’ll be your turn.", "A - There are some OBVIOUS risks involved with hitching. While it can be a great way to meet locals, get to off-the-beaten-track locations, and avoid long connections and wait times, you never know what kind of situation you are walking into. I am never going to reccommend hitch hiking, however, if you must hitch, you should know how to do it right. Only hitch hike during the day time, getting started as early as possible. If you have a weird feeling, AT ALL, don’t get in the car. I did my fair share of hitching in South Africa, and had a wonderful experience. But protect yourself. Download a maps app like MAPS.ME so you can follow along the route and find your destination easier.\n\nB – Hitch hiking is a legitimate form of travel here and people rely on it to get around. That means, if you are going to do it, expect to pay a small amount to the driver. It’s true, you may encounter some people who will take you for free, but it’s always best to offer lest you offend said driver. It usually is cheaper than the regular bus fare. Most people really just want the gas money."]

    "texts": ["There are a good number of local bus companies operating in South Africa and they range in price and comfort.", "That being said the best by far is, Intercape, an extensive bus network that operates all over South Africa has comfortable coaches at really reasonable prices. The buses are all air-conditioned, have reclining seats, and make pit stops for food etc regularly. The entertainment is a little JESUS-Y (like, BAD, made for TV christian movies…), and the constant reminders to pray to the good lord are a little grating, but hey, this is the top of the line when it comes to African bus travel, and you won’t find this kind of comfort on ANY buses if you are heading north of the border, so enjoy it while you can. They run on regular schedules and are rarely have mechanical issues.", "Local bus travel within cities like Johannesburg is mostly done with little white mini-vans. They’re often referred to as “black taxi’s” and are essentially mini-buses that ply mostly-regular routes around town. Always plan your route in advance when taking these and make sure you know where you are going. Don’t take the public transit at night.", "There are also big metro buses with official routes that work in zones. You can view their website here."]
