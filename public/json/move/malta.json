    "texts": ["Let’s talk about the public bus system of Malta. Ooft.", "Malta’s public transit system is actually pretty extensive. There are a ton of routes that criss-cross both islands, and even specific express buses that connect travelers with the ports and the airport. The bus fare is cheap (€1.50 in the winter and €2 in the summer, both are slightly more expensive at night), and your ticket is valid for up to 100 minutes from the moment of validation.", "There are also some fantastic, money saving combo tickets you can purchase, like 12 rides for €15, which is a great option for two people who want to share one card, since it can be used for both. Another option is to purchase an unlimited 7 day pass for €21, however this card can not be shared by two people, meaning both individuals would need to purchase their own card. For more information about the passes, and where to buy them, head to the Malta transit website here. This website includes the routes, timetables, and a journey planner as well.", "As much as I am a fan of cheap public transit, Malta’s system is being stretched to the limit. There has been a huge influx in the population here and buses are ALWAYS crowded. Traffic on the islands is terrible, meaning that buses are often caught in huge traffic jams, which makes them late constantly. It’s not uncommon to wait for more than 20 minutes past the scheduled time of arrival for your bus, so plan ahead if you’re going somewhere time-sensitive.", "Another odd idiosyncrasy of the bus system is that the buses seem to change numbers and routes constantly, and without warning. The bus will show up to the terminal as one route, and inexplicably change route numbers just before it leaves the station. You really need to be vigilant when getting on board.", "Asking a bus driver if they are stopping at your desired stop may yield little more than a shoulder shrug, so do your best to have your route mapped out and your desired stop marked on your GPS."]

    "texts": ["Malta’s international Airport (MLA) is located geographically in the center of the main island. This makes it a convenient jump off point to just about anywhere on the island, particularly Valletta and the surrounding towns. All buses marked with an X are airport buses and operate regular service to and from the airport from their designated starting points. You can catch the public bus directly in front of the airport.", "You can hire a cab to just about anywhere on the island from MLA for about €20 or less.", "The airport is moderately sized, although there are plans to make Malta the home of the budget airline RyanAir once Brexit goes into effect, so there could be some big changes happening here."]

You can either reserve it for an immediate pickup, or set a specific time and location for the cab to meet you. The price will be quoted when you make your reservation so you know exactly what to expect when you get in the car. Pay in advance or in cash upon arrival.\n\nYou don’t have to have an app in order to use the service, although it can be helpful. This is a great way to get around the island, particularly at night when the buses run on limited service and there is less traffic."]

The entire trip across the channel takes about 25 minutes to complete.", "The ferry terminal is located at the very northern tip of Malta at the port of Cirkewwa. Regular bus services operate from Valletta and Buggiba to the port. On Gozo, the very terminal is located at Mgarr, in the south of the island.", "The total cost of the ferry, roundtrip is €4.65 for adults. Passengers do not have to pay when departing Malta, but will pay the entire roundtrip fare before the return trip from Gozo. Roundtrip service for passengers with a vehicle is €15.70. Because of the regularity of service, there is no need to book tickets in advance.\n\nUp to date, accurate timetables are available at the Gozo Channel Ferry website.", "In addition to the Gozo Ferry, Valletta Ferry Services operates a small boat service on both sides of the Valletta peninsula, between Valletta and the three cities, as well as service between Valletta and Sliema. These are quick 10 minute boat rides across the water, costing about €1 each way. The boats operate every 30 minutes. This is a great way to avoid the traffic between these busy towns.","Ferries operate between the Maltese capital of Valletta and the Italian island of Sicily, with ports of call being Pozzallo (1 hour 45 mins) in the south, and Catania (3 hours +) in the east. Grimaldi Lines and Virtu Ferries operate the service on different days.\n\nThis option is not cheap, and the arrival times tend to be inconvenient, (like midnight arrival), but this option is available for those bringing a car or boat enthusiasts."]
