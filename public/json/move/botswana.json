Air Botswana is the national airline, however most flights from South Africa are operated by South African Airways. British Airways offers a direct flight to/from London.\n\nAdditionally, the Maun airport serves as the gateway to the north and there are several flights a day from Cape Town, Johannesburg, and Gaborone.","There isn’t a public bus service operating from the airport so taking a cab (about 20-30 pula per person) is the quickest way to make the 14 kilometer trek into the city. A lot of hotels offer a shuttle service into the city so it may be worth it to enquire with your hotel as taxis are a rare commodity at this airport.","For scenic flights over the Delta, a few small airlines operate out of the airstrip in Maun. Mack Air, Kavango Air, and Air Botswana all offer flights at competitive rates. Count on spending about $200-300 USD for a 30-45 minute flight. The cost is for the plane, not per person, however most planes only carry between 3-5 people per flight."]

    "texts": ["The great joy of renting vehicles abroad! The good news is that because there is so little in the way of public transit here, they have the rental process down to a science. Most of the rental companies will be in Kasane, Maun, or Gaborone, however it can often work out cheaper to rent your car in South Africa and drive it up.\n\nDepending on the time of year, and how long you will have the rental for, you should be able to negotiate with your rental agency, although I don’t recommend haggling so hard as to piss them off. These are the people outfitting you on your multi-day journey through the desert, so be nice. There aren’t a ton of them, but you’ll want to read some reviews, and ask as many questions as possible to get the clarification you need before you commit.","BUSHLORE is one of the best 4x4 rental companies on the continent, and a great starting point if you’re planning on going the 4×4 route. They have offices in Botswana, Namibia, and South Africa, with their main office located in Johannesburg.\n\nThough there are a lot of factors that go into pricing a rental, you should be able to find a fully equipped vehicle for somewhere in the ballpark of $80-110 USD per day depending on how much insurance coverage you take on (probably better not to skimp here).","I highly recommend going with a 4×4 as opposed to a regular car or truck. The majority of Botswana is off-road driving, and a good portion of the country can’t even be accessed with a 2-wheel drive.  You will be driving in mud, sand, gravel, and who knows what else. Be ready for it.","Do yourself a favor and pay extra for a small fridge and a gas cooker. Being able to self cater is crucial. Obviously make sure you have a spare tire, and water. Lot’s and lot’s of water. There could be times when you go 24 hours without seeing another person. Do not count on help from other people if you have a problem. Make sure you have everything you need to keep yourself going in case of emergency.","The vast majority of the roads that are paved in Botswana are new and fantastic. Most of the roads, are flat and empty. You will be able to cover a good bit of ground quickly while the roads are paved. Keep an eye out for animals, they can spook easy and hitting a leaping gazelle is not out of the realm of possibility.","Every so often you will encounter roadblocks and your car may be searched. Typically these are routine stops and shouldn’t hold you up much. It’s possible they may ask you to throw out any meats or eggs as a precaution for the spread of foot-and-mouth disease."]

    "texts": ["Long distance buses in Botswana only reliably operate along a few select routes. I wouldn’t count on it to travel independently outside of the major cities. That being said, Intercape does operate here and their operation is GREAT by African standards.", "Intercape, the same bus network that operates all over South Africa has comfortable coaches at really reasonable prices. The buses are all air-conditioned, have reclining seats, and make pit stops for food etc regularly. The entertainment is a little JESUS-Y (like, BAD, made for TV christian movies…), and the constant reminders to pray to the one true god are a little grating, but hey, this is the top of the line when it comes to African bus travel, and you won’t find this kind of comfort on ANY buses if you are heading north of the border, so enjoy it while you can. They are direct buses between Johannesburg and Gaborone (approx 9 hours).","Public transit for the rest of the country typically comes in the form of a minivan. This utilitarian form of transit is reminiscent of the dhala-dhalas in Tanzania, or the Matatus in Kenya, although they do feel a bit more organized and comfortable than their northern counterparts. The minivans usually travel between major cities with local stops along the way. Expect a packed house. These vans aren’t legally allowed to travel faster than 80km per hour, although they often choose to ignore this limit."]
