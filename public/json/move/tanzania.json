These small flights come at a premium cost however, so you have to weigh your options.", "The international airport in Dar es Salaam is about 10 kilometers out of the city center. Taxis are a fixed price and should cost you around $30 USD. Alternatively you can walk to the main road and flag one down if you want to negotiate a cheaper rate. Dala dalas (local minivan transport) can run you into the city from the main road as well. Just look for the ones marked POSTA (the main post office downtown), and you should be able to navigate to the city center from there. Keep in mind that you should only attempt this during the day, and you will want to make sure to ask the price before boarding as they may charge you extra if you’re traveling with a bag."]

    "texts": ["The Tanzanian Rail network isn’t bad as far as African travel goes, and it’s most certainly a more pleasant experience than bus travel. It is a little limited however, and you can only really rely on it to take you to the major urban centers, which, chances are, isn’t where you’re going. That being said, if you are on a route where trains go (Mwanza, Dodoma, Kigoma), jump on the chance to avoid the bus. Meals are available for purchase and local villagers will be selling produce and other essentials at every stop along the way. You won’t go hungry. There are some safety concerns if you are traveling alone so try to travel with other people. Keep your door locked especially if going over night and when sleeping.", "The Tazara Train line is the international train that connects Dar es Salaam with Kapiri Mposhi in Zambia. It operates twice a week and leaves Dar on Tuesdays and Fridays. Click here for more information.", "The train station is inconveniently located about 10 kilometers out of town. Ask your hotel for the going rate on cab fare, or better yet, which Daladala will get you there for cheap. If you are arriving into the station late, get a cab. Don’t take public transit after dark."]

You can expect traffic to be pretty backed up during the whole of the business day, so if you can, get an early start so you can get out of the city before the traffic gets bad.", "If you are renting in Tanzania, do yourself a favor and rent a 4×4. The roads here, even some of the main highways, are not well looked after. With seasonal rains causing regular damage to an already atrocious infrastructure, you can expect slow going. Potholes are everywhere, and if it’s unpaved, get ready for a muddy mess. Always remember to bring extra fuel and water with you just in case you get stuck somewhere.", "Don’t drive at night, ever. It’s just not safe for a number of reasons. Stay vigilant around other drivers.", "Many of the roads do not have a passing lane. Cars wishing to pass you will indicate with their right turn signal. If they are clear to pass, you will let them know by indicating with your left signal. If it’s not clear, indicate with your right, so they know not to pass. It’s a little complicated, but the polite way to drive."]

    "texts": ["My relationship with the Tanzanian bus system is a long and storied one. To put it bluntly, traveling by bus in Tanzania can be a nightmare. The roads are reeeeeally bad, especially in the wet season, and depending on the route you’re taking you’ll likely be trundling along at a whopping 40 kilometers an hour. In a gigantic country like Tanzania, this means it can take hours longer than you thought to get anywhere, and that isn’t even accounting for breakdowns. Which happen. A lot.", "If you’re on your own chances are you’ll be taking the bus. The good news is that it’s very cheap. A ten hour bus ride is usually about $10 or less.", "Bus stations are chaotic. There are a ton of competing bus companies. Some will want you to buy a ticket from the office, most will just have you pay on board. In some cases there are “luxury” buses, which means only two seats per row on each side of the bus. If you are given this option, TAKE IT. The alternative and much more common situation is a 5-seat row scenario, with an improvised 6th seat fashioned out of a stool or upside down bucket. No matter how you slice it you will be getting intimate with your neighbors, but if you can squirrel your way onto a 4-seater… kudos to you.", "Always start your journey as early as possible. For one, it’s likely that the bus won’t actually depart until it’s full, so if you want a good seat, or ANY seat for that matter, it’s prudent to arrive early. Whatever the estimated travel time you’re given by the ticket taker, add 50% on to that estimate. If he tells you 8 hours, plan for 12. 10 hours? It’s going to be a 15 hour trip. It’s rare that you will make it to your destination before dark, but try anyway. Leaving as early as possible is your best bet. Most bus stations are already wild with activity by 5 am. This nice side bonus of this is you will definitely be able to get a good breakfast and some coffee from any number of mama’s cooking up meals at the station. Fortify yourself well. You will need it for the journey.", "By the 8th hour your head may feel like it’s about to explode, either from the insanely loud music emanating from the rattling speakers or the constant shaking of the entire bus as it thrusts back and forth along the uneven pot-holed roads. If hell exists, it may be a bus in rural Tanzania. Well, Mzungu hell anyway, the Tanzanian’s don’t seem to bat an eye. Anger quickly fades to shame, and at the end of the day it’s one big lesson in humility and patience. A lesson you get to learn again… and again… and again, until one day you decide to buy a plane ticket.", "Many tourists opt for short commuter flights, private cars, and tour operators to get them from place to place, and it doesn’t take long to figure out why. The problem with those wonderful commuter flights and air conditioned private transfers is that they cost a lot. It’s not a bad option if you’re traveling with others and can throw in on a shared taxi to split the cost. You’ll save time and definitely be more comfortable. Work out the price with a local driver, or ask your hotel if they have a trusted resident driver, chances are they know someone."]
