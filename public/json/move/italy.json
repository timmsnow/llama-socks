For now things appear to be stable within the airline, thanks to the help of several other companies including the state railway and fellow SkyTeam Alliance member Delta Airlines. The food is surprisingly meh on Alitalia, but trans-Atlantic flights tend to be pretty affordable.", "Recently a competing airline called Air Italy has started operating international flights in the hopes of replacing Alitalia, and although they have fewer contracted flights, it can sometimes be a cheaper option.", "Rome has two airports: Fiumicino (FCO – Leonardo Da Vinci) and Ciampino (CIA), the latter generally associated with regional budget airlines.\n\nMilan Malpensa (MXP) is the primary international airline for Milan, with Linate (LIN), and  Bergamo (BGY) offering alternative service.\n\nOther notable airport hubs in Italy include:\n\nNaples (NAP – Capodichino), Venice (VCE – Marco Polo),  Turin (TRN – Sandro Pertini)\n\nand in Sicily: Palermo (PMO – Punta Raisi), and Catania (CTA – Vincenzo Bellini)"]

Their website displays routes, timetables, and a trip planner. Buying a ticket early can often come with a discount.\n\nThere are three different types of trains to take note of with Trenitalia.", "These are the regional trains that generally make all stops. Generally these are the cheapest tickets, and the trains vary greatly in age and condition. You’ve got about a 70/30 chance of working air conditioning on these trains. The Regionale Veloce is the express regional train, which make fewer stops and are priced a little higher than the regular Regionale trains, but still pretty light on the wallet.", "The InterCity trains are considered long-distance train services. For this reason, if you are traveling with a RailPass you will most likely need to make a seat reservation in order to have a valid seat on the train. Point to point tickets are sometimes cheaper if purchased in advance.", "The “arrow” trains are the pride and joy of Italian Rail Travel. These are the bullet trains that call primarily at the big city destinations, and so make fewer stops. These Freccie can travel up to 360 kmh. They’re a joy to ride, but can be expensive. A €10 seat reservation is required for all Rail pass holders.", "In addition to TrenItalia, there is a private company called “Italotreno” (aka NTV), which operates high-speed trains similar to the Freccias, at competitive prices. The Rail Pass does not include the Italotreno.\n\nMost major cities have local regional lines also not connected to the Trenitalia network (Circumvesuviana for example handles a good chunk of the regional traffic in the greater Naples area.)  These regional trains are not included with the rail pass, however the distances are short and prices tend to be negligible."]

If you are spending any portion of your trip in rural areas, or plan on driving on any backroads, you may want to seriously consider getting tire and windshield coverage. Small rocks flung from under the wheels of trucks and lorries can crack a heated windshield in the summer sun, and poorly maintained roads can make a quick work of a well-worn tire.", "Apart from the general rule of thumb in Italy being “drive FAST/just GO”, you should also note that traffic laws, particularly in the south are rarely closely followed. Speed limits are ignored, and stop signs (rare in the first place) rarely have any effect.", "GPS can be pretty untrustworthy in Italy, you’ll often find yourself being directed down a one way street, or through a brick wall….", "Driving through the city centers, especially in smaller towns can quickly become a harrowing experience since roads can shrink from two lane to donkey-cart size in a matter of blocks. Most towns have a ring road of sorts that allows you to bypass the center. If you’re just passing through the town, it’s likely better to shoot for the bypass."]

If that’s a no-go, you’ll have to pay onboard for a higher price."]
