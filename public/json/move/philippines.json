    "texts": ["Flying in the Philippines is mandatory. Traveling anywhere here takes a good deal of time and sometimes flights are the only way to make it happen. Whether it’s a puddle-jumper or an airbus, you’re gonna get a LOT of aerial island views.", "Manila’s NAIA airport has been called “the worlds worst airport”, which I think is maybe a _bit_ unfair… I mean, anyone who’s spent more than an hour or so in Maputo International Airport’s departure lounge in Mozambique, knows what I’m talking about… or Jomo Kenyatta in Nairobi for that matter, they’re both terrible… but I digress. The point is, maybe don’t linger too long if you can help it and head straight for the taxi queue ASAP after immigration.", "The taxi’s in Manila are pretty notorious for trying to pull one over on tourists, especially at the airport. Chances are you won’t be getting a metered ride, so if you are heading into the city center it should’t cost more than $10-15 for the trip. I’ve heard stories of people paying upwards of $60, which is bonkers.", "Weight restrictions are taken pretty seriously here. Chances are your baggage will be weighed EVERY time. So if you were thinking you might be able to sneak by with a few extra kilos, I’d say it’s unlikely.\n\nOne time, when I was flying from Coron, I was told to step on the scale at check-in to weigh myself to ensure the plane wasn’t overloaded. I weigh 140 lbs (63 kilos)…. and they had to weigh me. Not a good set up for an anxiety-free flight, but that’s the Philippines for you.", "Flights get delayed and cancelled ALL the time. This is in part because of the weather, in part because there are a ton of flights criss-crossing the islands all day long, and in part just cause. I advise you to be prepared for it. As much as it pains me to suggest spending an extra night in Manila, if you are relying on an internal flight to get you to your international one, you may need an extra day of padding just in case."]

    "texts": ["Well you can’t spend any time in the Philippines and not experience the charms of the colorful Jeepney. You will hear them before you see them, and you’ll smell them before that. These brightly painted road monsters are recycled military vehicles left over from the American occupation in the early half of the 20th century, and they absolutely smell like it. They run on diesel, the fumes of which billow out of their backsides in heavy black clouds, a thick nebulosity unseen since the industrial revolution. All across Manila the air quality is… mmm, lacking, and the noise pollution is equally uncomfortable. They are the main transport network of the city and surprisingly easy to jump in and out of if you want to give commuting like a Manileño a try. I mean, “when in hell” right?", "Outside of the city the air gets a little clearer and Jeepneys actually start to show their softer side. Compared to the terrifyingly top-heavy commuter buses that weave their way around the hairpin turns that line the mountains on the route to places like Sagada or Banaue in northern Luzon, the Jeepneys provide an alternative with a lower center of gravity. If you’re getting around by bus in the mountains, give the Jeepney a go. They are extremely budget-friendly, and most of the time you can convince the driver to let you ride on the roof for the best views the mountains have to offer. Just keep a look out for oncoming branches, and hold on tight in case they have to brake hard… which they will… all the time."]

There were numerous times on my trip in the Philippines where I thought “Oh, a nice boat ride, what a wonderful alternative to ANOTHER exhausting Jeepney/Bus/Plane ride,” and then it turned out to be an exhausting, nail-biting experience in it’s own right.", "There was the boat ride from Sabang to Port Barton that was so over-capacity that with every swell the cabin erupted into fearful prayers from the terrified locals. Even the roaches that lived in our life-preservers seemed alarmed as they pitter-padded their way across our disheveled, sea-soaked bodies.", "Then there was the time I negotiated with a local fisherman to take myself and a couple other travelers to San Vicente, only to be followed by another fisherman for over an hour as he waved his machete at us and continually made slicing gestures at his throat while pointing toward our destination…", "And of course, who can forget the electrifying boat ride from El Nido to Coron, where 80% of the passengers on board continuously puked as the sun beat down on our heads for 8 hours straight while questionable pinging sounds rang out from the sides of the hull, lulling us into a sorrowful acceptance of an early demise…", "Now I’m not saying you’re going to die if you choose to travel by boat in the Philippines, I’m just saying you might. Your biggest worry should be over-crowding, so if it looks like the boat is a little too full, it probably is. Get out of the boat.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, some boats are fine! Some boats are great! Just… some really, really aren’t. Work on spotting the difference."]
