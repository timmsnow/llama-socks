    "texts": ["The most notable airlines operating within Peru include: LATAM , LC Perú , Peruvian Airlines , Star Perú , and Viva Air (budget airline).", "Buying tickets on foreign websites is always more expensive than getting them when you are in Peru. If you can, wait until you arrive in the country to book your domestic flight on the official Peruvian website for the airline. That being said, read the website carefully and make sure the price you are paying isn’t “resident only”. Occasionally local airlines will charge foreigners more to make a booking, which could lead to some problems at the check-in gate. All of the Peruvian airlines have offices within Lima, so if you have any issues booking online you should be able to waltz right into the sales office and purchase a ticket on the spot.", "Flying domestically between major cities is rarely an issue, and there tends to be a decent amount of availability and some wiggle room to book even up to a couple days before your flight. If you are trying to get somewhere a little more obscure, on a smaller regional plane, you may want to book your flight well in advance since there may be only one or two flights servicing your destination per week.", "Some smaller regional aircraft may make several stops before landing at their final destination. Make sure you check your itinerary closely to see if there are added stops on your regional flight.", "Allow yourself plenty of time to check in and get through security when preparing for a flight. I recommend 2 hours even for domestic flights, since airports can often get a bit chaotic, especially at the smaller terminals where less people are working the desks.", "Nine times out of ten, if you are flying internationally your long haul flight will be into or out of Lima. If your final destination is Cusco, you’ll likely be transiting in the Lima airport and going through customs there in-between your flights. If you are flying to another country in South America you may be able to skip Lima, depending on your final destination."]

    "section": ["", "Documentation", "Agree on the Price First", "Airport Taxi", "Uber"],
    "texts": ["Taxis are extremely easy to come across in the bigger cities around Peru. They’ll be waiting outside every bus station, airport, mall and cinemas. and be flagged down on the streets relatively easily. For the most part taxis are easily identifiable, although in Cuzco some of the taxis are less obvious.", "All taxis should have some kind of documentation posted clearly for the passenger to see. While the majority of Peru’s taxi drivers are extremely friendly, regular, work-a-day people, there are, ofcourse, some pretenders. If you can’t see any documentation, get out of the cab.", "You will be hard pressed to find a taxi with a meter so you’ll have to negotiate the taxi fare before getting into the cab. It can be somewhat difficult to estimate the costs of every distance in every city while you are traveling so the best strategy is to ask someone beforehand what an approximate cost should be (at your hotel/hostel, or at the restaurant where you’re eating lunch for example). You can pretty much bet that you’ll be quoted an inflated price as a tourist. This is OK. This is normal. Exercise your right to haggle lightly, and if you feel the price is way too high, move on to the next taxi for a comparison. It may take a few tries, but eventually you’ll land on a price you’re comfortable with. Note that prices are almost always more at night.", "If you decide to take a taxi from the airport, always take the official taxi service, especially in Lima. Alternatively there are express shuttle buses to the center of town.", "While Uber may operate in Lima, it isn’t recommended for several reasons. Prices tend to be higher, wait times much longer, and cancelations common. Plus, with the traffic as bad as it is in the big city, you probably want a cabbie with years of experience who knows their way around the problem areas. Just a thought."]

    "texts": ["Bus travel is the number one mode of transit in Peru, meaning that there is an extensive network of long distance buses plying the roads and highways all across the country.", "Because of the amount of long distance travelers, great strides have been made in creating comfortable bus travel at affordable prices.", "A lot of people who travel in Peru with take buses in one direction, say Lima to Cuzco, making stops in cities or towns 8-10 hours apart from each other along the way, then when they’ve traveled the maximum distance from Lima, fly back with a one way ticket to avoid the 20-24 hour bus ride back.", "Bus travel can be made even more efficient by taking night buses to save time and money. The luxury buses that offer the 160° seat recline are the tops when it comes to comfort, and definitely your best bet for a pleasant nights sleep. They may be more expensive than the standard seat bus, but with the money you’re saving on accommodation it more than pays for itself. A warning that once you’ve traveled on one of these buses you’ll be ruined for the rest of your life, since no standard bus will ever come close to being as comfortable.", "Hands down the most reliable and comfortable bus service in Peru is Cruz Del Sur. The VIP seats on the first floor of the bus have the widest recline range and feel a bit like a business class seat on an airplane. Movies, charging stations, and light “meals” are included in the ticket price. You can even book online, which makes it extremely easy to secure your seat. You WILL want to book at least a day in advance if you want the VIP seats. The only problem with Cruz Del Sur is that they don’t service the whole of the country. Mostly the coastal regions and the tourist hot-spots. Both Ormeño and Oltursa make for good alternatives."]
