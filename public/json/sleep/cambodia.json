    "texts": ["Accommodation in Cambodia is always in flux. While there are a TON of good, cheap, basic backpacker hostels and hotels all over the country, quality and consistency can change with the wind. The best strategy for finding a good room is to do the old fashioned walkabout. Booking in advance during high season may be a good idea on islands like Koh Rong, but generally you won’t need to reserve anything in the main metropolitan areas. Having a few places written down before you arrive and then checking out a couple options can be a good way to find out the going rate and the quality of whats on offer. I’ve included a few places that I stayed in during my trips, but don’t let that limit your search. There are new places popping up all the time, and what you end up paying will largely depend on your ability to negotiate."]

    "texts": ["All of the backpacker joints along Tui Beach are pretty much varying degrees of the same thing, so shop around. Most have simple rooms, on-site reataurants/bars, and a convivial atmosphere. If you are looking for a younger, partying crowd, this is the beach for you. The loudest portion is concentrated in the center near the pier, but it tends to get quieter and hippier if you head to the far sides of the beach.", "Just over the hill from Tui beach (or a short boat ride if you get the water taxi), lies beautiful Sok San Beach. This is South East Asian beach perfection. It’s a beautiful, quiet strip of seemingly never-ending white sand beach with a much quieter, laid back vibe than raucous Tui. There are a few resorts and bungalows here to choose from, and they range significantly in both price and quality. I recommend taking a peak at the digs before you lock them in. Sok San Beach Resort has good quality rooms. A bit pricier than some of the other options, but check online for deals, or show up and see what you can get. This is a beautiful beach to call home for a few days, but keep in mind that staying on this side of the island means you are more limited when it comes to food options."]

There are tons of great, low-cost backpackers down in Otres and it’s pretty easy to find something for a good rate. Otres tends to be a budget friendly destination, so don’t expect 5 stars. Just simple huts with good eats and friendly people.", "This fully Cambodian run bungalow style accomodation sits right on beautiful Otres Beach, just outside of Sihanoukville. There is an onsite restaurant and bar, a relaxed attitude, and they offer tuk-tuk pickup service from Sihanoukville if you need it. Their facebook page is here.", "These adorable little beach bungalows are some of the better quality ones on offer in Otres and accommodation comes with free breakfast. Their standard pricing is a bit higher than some of the other places, but you should be able to negotiate a decent rate, especially if you are spending more than a day or two in Otres."]

Since there are so many places offering cheap accommodation, theres no reason why you need to commit to one.", "This place has the classic European backpacker vibe that should be familiar to anyone used to staying in hostels. There is a cute lounge area, with a bar, friendly staff, and (mostly) clean facilities. They can help with arranging onward travel. Velkommen is in a central location and is a good place to meet other travelers.", "With a slightly more buttoned-up feel than a lot of the other budget options, Greenhouse offers an oasis from the typical rowdy drink-til-you-drop backpacker hostels that are ubiquitous in South East Asia. The rooms here are clean, cool, and (mostly) well lit. Greenhouse feels like a hotel rather than a hostel, and it’s really great value for your money. It’s a good place to re-center after a long hot day in the city."]

If you are looking for something quieter, you can generally find good value budget accommodation on the other side of the canal in the neighborhood surrounding Wat Bo. Walk around, check out a few places. Most hotels will be willing to work with you on price and inclusions.", "A simple but clean option in the budget area around Wat Bo. Sweet Dreams has a pool, which is nice after a long hot day exploring Angkor Wat. There is also an onsite restaurant and the rooms are air conditioned. It is one of many solid options in the area and is extremely affordable.", "If you’re looking for something with less of the back-packer vibe, but still a good cheapie, Takeo offers clean, air conditioned rooms for travelers on a budget. There’s a nice rooftop terrace and a restaurant serving local and western food. Breakfast is included in the price, and they have bicycles you can use to explore Angkor Park. Everyone at Golden Takeo is friendly and accommodating."]
