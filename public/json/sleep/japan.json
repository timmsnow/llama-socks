    "texts": ["Often utilized by business men, or single people on a budget with minimal space requirements. They are also known as “PODS”, and these hotels are essentially dormitories in the form of little compartments. These pods are meant for single person occupancy. They can be stacked on top of each other or not, depending on the hotel. The space is generally about the size of a twin bed but will include a personal TV (with headphones), internal lighting, bed clothes and slippers, and other sleeping accoutrement. They are cheaper than most hotels. It’s like a hostel 2.0. Except _extremely_ quiet. You will be thrown out for making noise, and rightfully so, this is not a party house.", "Don’t be thrown off by the term “business”, they can be for anyone. In fact these are the hotels most tourists end up staying in since they most resemble western-style hotels. They are generally basic, but clean (it’s Japan). These guys range in price, but would be on the cheaper side and can be a good utilitarian go-to if your limited on options.", "The Minshuku is my preferred accommodation choice. They are a sort of Japanese-style B and B and they range in price from expensive to moderate to budget. Typically rooms will be the Japanese-style tatami mat, sleep-on-the-floor kind of room, and price is based more on how many people are occupying it than the room type itself. All of them will include the general Japanese fixings, such as the Yukata (japanese robe), which you can wear in or out of your room, depending on what you’re getting into and how fancy you’re feeling. Minshuku’s can be a fantastic budget option, however IF they have a website it will probably be in Japanese. You can try to reserve by email, but the best way is probably to call. You may want to ask the reception of your hotel to call and make the reservation for you.", "There are some opportunities to stay in Buddhist temples during your time in Japan. The experience typically includes your meals, and participation in prayers is generally required. I didn’t have any real luck in this department as the temples I reached out to said they didn’t take any non-Japanese speakers. That doesn’t mean there aren’t those that will, but I struck out. It sounds like a great experience, but definitely exercise extreme consideration here, there are about a billion ways to offend a monk in a temple. Tread lightly.", "The Ryokan is the absolute height of the Japanese guest experience and considered to be a destination in its own right. It’s much more than just a place to lay your body, it’s a full-on immersive experience from start to finish. Ryokans are not cheap, but a good Ryokan is worth a thousand Minshukus. It’s essentially a traditional Japanese hotel (typically tatami-mat style accommodation), but with full board and service included, with the meals typically representative of the area of Japan in which you are staying. Full days can be spent inside without ever leaving the Ryokan. On-site onsens are almost always involved, and your time can be spent shuffling from a delicious meal to the baths, back to more food, maybe a stop at your room for some sake and a nap, then back to the baths and more delicious food. It’s the ultimate in self-pampering, essentially a spa, Japanese style, and it is fucking great. Some Ryokans are hundreds of years old. It’s an experience unto itself and one that’s definitely worth splashing out for, even just for one night."]

    "section": ["1 - First Cabin, Akasaka", "2 - 9 Hours, multiple locations"],
    "texts": ["This is the creme de la creme of the Capsule hotel scene. It’s located in Akasaka, which is a laid-back, though notably upscale neighborhood near central Tokyo. The neighborhood is well connected by the metro, and there are plenty of food and drink options around the hotel itself. The modern feel and sleek design of the reception hall gives more of a luxury hotel vibe than a budget accommodation situation. The staff is courteous, and while there is an onsite Onsen, they will explain upon check in that it is OFF LIMITS to those with tattoos. This is pretty common from Tokyo hotels, but the private bathroom and shower facilities are so fancy they may as well be a spa anyway. The capsules are pretty spacious (for a pod) and they don’t lack for comfort. First Cabin is a great place to try out the Capsule scene, however, don’t expect this kind of plush digs at your next one. They aren’t all like this.", "9 hours is a capsule hotel chain that offers pods for a full nights stay OR short naps. It’s more chic than say… a “love hotel”, but not as upscale as First Cabin. The nice thing about 9 hours is that they have multiple locations and are reliably clean and comfortable. The pods are a standard size (small!) but everything works as expected and the POD fundamentals remain the same. The Shinjuku location is convenient for those wanting to stay in a lively area. Bear in mind that checkout times are strictly enforced, so no lolly-gaggin."]

    "texts": ["Oh Beautiful Tsuru No Yu. This place is about 350 years old and is about as traditional as it gets. The buildings are beautifully constructed wooden marvels and everywhere you look you find exquisite, colorful detailings of a bygone era. It’s located high up a mountain in northern Honshu, near Lake Tazawako. The meals are multi-course works of art cooked over an open flame dug out of the floor in the dining hall, and the onsite onsen houses 4 hot, steaming baths of different compositions, and one gigantic outdoor sulfur spring that’s perfect for socializing and star gazing after dinner. Tsuro No Yu is an unforgettable highlight, and one that needs to be booked in advance, as it’s a famous Ryokan in Japan. Best to have someone who speaks Japanese call to reserve the room for you.", "Noboribetsu is an onsen town in southern Hokkaido, known for the steamy sulfuric geysers that surround the entire town and erupt in exciting displays throughout the day. Dao-Ichi Takimotokan and the neighboring Takimoto Inn both get you access to one of the greatest onsen experiences in the entire country. Not technically Ryokan, but with over 15 hot springs to choose from, the Onsen here requires a mention.", "Wow. Kozantei is a modern Ryokan that screams luxury. The views of Mount Fuji across the lake are out of this god damn world (if theres no cloud coverage that is…). The rooms here are super fancy and some come with a private “onsen” on your outside deck overlooking the lake. The meals are of the highest quality. It’s expensive as f."]

    "texts": ["This little hotel/minshuku was a diamond in the rough. While the lobby did smell a little bit like stale cigarette smoke, the friendly owners were happy to accommodate my party of three in one of their traditional tatami-mat rooms. It was extremely budget friendly for the area, since Fujikawaguchiko is a pretty pricey holiday destination (especially around Golden week). The room was simple, but comfortable, and there was even a little on-site onsen for us to use. Everything in town is walking distance so even being slightly out of the center is fine. You can make reservations through email, on a booking website, or over the phone.", "Eiko is the owner of the the Fuga Guesthouse and is as sweet as the muffins she gave to us when we arrived. She speaks perfect English (not that that’s really important), but aided us in everyday possible. She gave us free bikes to use, which is really the best way to get around Kakunodate, and made sure we had everything we needed. The room was comfortable and had everything a bumbling tourist could want. I highly recommend staying here, if nothing else for the good conversation with Eiko. She’ll leave you feeling welcomed, and looked after. Reserve by email."]
