    "texts": ["South Africa has a plethora of good accommodation options. It’s one of the few countries in Africa the has a true “backpacker culture”. That means that prices are competitive and there tends to be a higher standard for budget accommodation than you might find elsewhere, in say, Zimbabwe or Zambia. There also tends to be a lot more mid-range options, which is great for traveling couples and 30-somethings wanting a little more space and comfort. These are a just a couple places that I can personally impart my experience of."]

    "texts": ["The artistic neighborhood of Observatory is about three train stops out from the city center. It’s an adorable up-and-coming suburb with restaurants and shops all focused around a central main drag, upon which sits this delightful backpackers. It’s nothing terribly fancy, but theres a garden and bbq area, plunge pool, the rooms are clean and well maintained and breakfast is included in the room price. It’s easy enough to get to and from the center using the train during the day, and at night you can hang out in the local area or catch a cheap cab into town. It’s a nice way to see another side of Cape Town.", "Located in a quieter neighborhood in central Cape Town, Big Blue is a simple and clean hostel with affordable rooms and an onsite bar and swimming pool. The building has good security and there are lockers in the rooms. It’s an easy walk down to the waterfront, and the beaches can be accessed by the local bus close by. There is a social atmosphere, but it isn’t a party hostel like some of the others in the downtown area. This is a great place to have a sun-downer with a couple fellow travelers while you plan your ascent of Table Mountain."]

    "texts": ["Situated in the neighborhood of Melville… get it? Melvilla?? This guesthouse is adorable and well looked after. It’s pretty good bang for your rand, and breakfast is included in the booking. The grounds are comfortable and the common areas are a good place to unwind after a day walking around the city. It’s not the cheapest budget option out there, but it’s well located and the staff is helpful. Great base of operations for exploring Joburg.", "There is a lot to be said for this simple, straight-forward backpacker lodge located in Randburg. These guys have dorms, singles, and double rooms at affordable rates, and serve as a one stop shop for travelers who might not have access to their own transportation. The people at zoo lodge can arrange an airport shuttle, organize tours throughout South Africa, or set up smaller trips to local places like the Apartheid Museum. The lodge is also located in a safe area on Jan Smuts Ave near a public bus stop, making getting around a breeze for those interested in trying their hand at public transit. Simple, clean, and affordable, this place is a perfect starting point for independent minded travelers. Visit their website here."]

    "texts": ["Just a few hops away from back-packer filled Coffee Bay, is the slightly-off-the-beaten path Xhosa village of Lubanzi. This is rural land, and the verdant rolling hills are dotted with colorful rondavel huts all the way to rocky cliffs overlooking the Indian Ocean. Wild Lubanzi is the kind of place all travelers dream they can end up once they’re ready to hangup their backpack. A beautiful, organic farm, surrounded by simple huts and a few essential livestock. It’s easy to spend your days here laying in a hammock, with a beer in hand, and watching the sun go down at the edge of the world.", "Urban Plett is a centrally located apartment building consisting of 4 modern, immaculate units that all have kitchenettes and private bathrooms. It’s an alarmingly chic and comfortable option considering the low price, and a great base of operations for exploring the surrounding area and hitting up the beach. There is a garden for relaxing and most units include a dining area or a terrace. Definitely good value for money here."]

This place has a social atmosphere, without being obnoxious, and, with an onsite tour operator, is able to provide all the outdoor activities, accessible at group rates. The accommodation is adorable, with everything from dorm rooms to doubles to chalets, with classic rondavel style huts available on the cheap. Getting here without a car isn’t super easy but if you contact them they can probably help you arrange something if you get yourself to Pietermaritzburg. They can arrange trips around the Drakensbergs and into Lesotho, which I highly recommend.", "This place is beautiful. Perfectly set at the base of the mountains on a huge slice of gorgeous green Earth, this is a great place to be if you want to get away from it all. They have a backpackers lodge for budget travelers, self catering rondavel huts, and even camp ground facilities for the heartier stock. Khotso has been arranging horse back riding trips in the area for years, even taking guests across the border into Lesotho for an unforgettable ride. These guys know what they’re doing. It’s social but peaceful, the perfect mountain getaway."]
