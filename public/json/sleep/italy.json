    "texts": ["Finding good budget accommodation in Italy can be challenging, but it does exist. There are plenty of gems out there that have the right combination of comfort, location, and price, but you may have to do some digging. A lot of people opt to Airbnb while in Italy. Often these rentals are super central, affordable, and come with kitchen access, which is a godsend for those hoping to cut down on food costs. Be wary of anyone who expects you to pay for the “electricity costs” of your rental. Electricity costs can be highly variable in Italy and are often quite expensive, especially if the building has a substandard efficiency classification. Airbnb hosts passing off their electricity bill to vacationers is a thing that happens, and it shouldn’t.\n\nThe vast majority of hotels in Italy will either provide some sort of breakfast included in the cost, or will offer it as an additional up-charge for those interested. Parking can be difficult in Italy, so if you’re planning on driving, double check if your hotel offers free parking (or any parking for that matter).\n\nRemember that Italian law requires the collection of city taxes for all foreign tourists in Italy. This is a set amount to be charged PER PERSON, per night that you stay in any given city. The tax ranges anywhere from €1-4 per person/per night. There is no getting around it, so PAY UP."]

    "texts": ["It honestly doesn’t get more central than this B and B tucked onto a side street just a few blocks away from the Colosseum, Constantine’s Arch, and the Roman Forum. For a mid-range hotel, the prices here really can’t be beat. The rooms are clean, comfortable, and some of them come equipped with guest kitchens. The streets surrounding the hotel are safe, relatively quiet, and are home to a few decent and one spectacular restaurant (La Taverna dei Quaranta).", "Another GREAT budget/mid-range option, this hotel is located just across the river in the hot spot of Trastevere. Right on the main drag, you’ll have access to all the great cafes, restaurants, and bars of the Trastevere neighborhood. If your room has a balcony you can opt to take your breakfast there. Check out their website here.", "The rooms over at Cantalupa are bigger than they look in the pictures. The rooms are airy, light, and most have balconies. The guest kitchen access is a score, and the location in this up-and-coming, less visited corner of Rome will give you a unique perspective of the Eternal City. You can view their website here."]

    "texts": ["NOT to be confused with the pizza place, this Casa is run by a super-sweet family who lives in the attached apartment in the back of the hotel, though you’d never know it. The owners do everything they can to make sure your privacy is maintained and your stay is comfortable. The two available rooms get lot’s of natural light, with gigantic windows overlooking the street below. There is a guest kitchen available for use and a full breakfast provided daily. If you’re lucky, you may just get spoiled with a freshly baked cake on arrival.", "If you have any plans to stop by the ruins of the Greek City of Selinunte (and you really, really should), make sure to secure a room at this relatively new B and B. The property is set on an idyllic piece of farmland, about 3 kilometers outside of town, and has all the comforts of a 4 star hotel, for a fraction of the cost. The staff is extremely hospitable, the rooms are spacious, brand new, and clean, and the breakfast is included and fantastic. Check out the website here.", "The Refugio is getting a mention primarily because it’s literally at the bottom Mt Etna, making it the most convenient place to stay if you’re hoping to beat the crowds on a hike up to the top. The proximity for the price is unbeatable. The hotel itself is a cute little wooden mountain lodge, and there are some fun pictures hanging on the walls of the Volcano exploding pretty much right on top of the hotel. **Note, the onsite restaurant is extremely mediocre."]

    "texts": ["Just a few blocks from the train station, and not far from the city center, Casa Italia offers brand new, spacious, and well lit rooms for a budget price. You can opt for an ensuite room or get the shared bathroom and save a bit of money. The neighborhood is safe, and buses pass right by the front door. The breakfast is nothing to write home about, but there is complementary coffee and snacks throughout the day. Check out their site here.", "Now I’ll be the first to admit that Hotel Siena is no luxury operation, but the location really couldn’t be better, and double rooms in this neighborhood generally go for twice the price. This hotel is close to the train station, in a trendy neighborhood with a ton of good food options, and directly in front of a tram line. Those in a platonic room-sharing situation should be warned that the showers happen to be fully exposed in the rooms, and the toilets are shared. The hotel itself is certainly clean, if a little weathered.", "This place, high on the Sciliar Plateau in the Dolomites, wins all the points for location and charm. The Refugio is built where hiking trails meet, and the only way to get there is by way of a 3-4 hour vertical hike up the mountain. Make sure you’ve reserved your stay before attempting the climb, since the last thing you’ll want to here is “No Occupancy”. Trust me when I say that beer never tasted so good. The Apple strudel wasn’t bad either. Private rooms sell out fast, but the lodge dorms should be ok for one night."]

The buffet breakfast spread is massive and the location (one block from the beach) is perfect for anyone interested in sun fun. The hotel recently expanded and owns a satellite property a short drive down the road. These self-contained units are extra private, brand new, and come outfitted with outdoor terraces and lounge areas. If you can, ask to stay there. You can peep their website here.", "Ok, to say that Alle Conche is anywhere near a budget hotel would be more than a stretch. But every once in a while, you find yourself staying in the right place, in the right city, where spending a little extra just makes sense. The Guesthouse Alle Conche is one of those places. Matera is already something of a fairytale city and this guesthouse keeps the theme going with it’s gorgeous, well manicured rooms carved right out of the cave rock. For the quality on offer here, you’d expect the price point to be much, much higher. Breakfast is WORTH it.", "The white star in the white city, this holiday apartment is the perfect size for a couple who’s looking for a budget room right in the historic center of town. This is an apartment so plan on being self-sufficient. That being said, you won’t find a cheaper place in this area of town. There is no website, but Stella Bianca can be booked on any number of online booking sites."]
