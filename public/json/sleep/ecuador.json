You can count on many places offering breakfast, airport shuttles, or tour packages to sweeten the deal.\n\nIn the off-peak season it shouldn’t be too hard to find a place last minute, but during high season you should absolutely book ahead, especially in more isolated areas like Quilotoa, where you’re less likely to get your first choice should you arrive late. It is not uncommon to get discounts during low season."]

    "texts": ["Situated right on the main drag running down to the port, this charming little Hostal is about as central as it gets in Puerto Ayora. For budget accommodation the rooms are of excellent quality, with decent private bathrooms and big, airy rooms. There is a rooftop terrace where you can take your breakfast, or enjoy a sunset beer. No website, but can be found on booking sites.", "Right around the corner from Flightless Cormorant, and just next to “Eagle Ray Dive Center”, this budget hotel is the cheapest option in central Puerto. The rooms are smaller than at Cormorant, but the standard is still excellent, all things considered, and the staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. This is an excellent choice for those trying to stretch the $$.", "This 3-star hotel is great value for money. Situated on a quieter street in central San Cristobal, this hotel serves as a great base of operations for exploring the island. The rooms are tidy, the staff is helpful, and breakfast can be had at the restaurant just outside on the ground floor. It’s a slight step up in price from some of the more run-down budget hotels that line the waterfront, but given the standard of service, and the level of comfort, it’s worth it."]

    "texts": ["Alieda’s is an exceptionally welcoming and warm hotel set in the quieter side of the Florestra/Mariscal Sucre area of Quito. It’s close to the main nightlife area without being affected by any of the noise. The hotel itself is cozy and clean, and can arrange airport pick-ups upon request. The price for a double room is good for the quality of service and typically includes breakfast in the courtyard downstairs. The woman running the place is adorable and extremely kind.", "A step up the budget ladder from Alieda’s, Casa Vintage is a great place to stay if you’re looking for a slightly more upscale environment to ride out your altitude acclimatization. Excellently located in the Mariscal Sucre neighborhood, Casa Vintage is safe, clean, and offers perks like Spa packages and jacuzzi-style bathtubs, for an extremely affordable price.", "If you’re dying to stay in the Historic Old Town of Quito, this hotel is a great option. While the building itself can be a little echo-y, the rooms are well-kept and good value for money compared with other properties in the area. This is an excellent place to stay if you want to explore the Old Town during the day, but bear in mind that the area tends to feel a little less… romantic after dark. The hotel can arrange taxis as needed."]

    "texts": ["This little Hotel/Restaurant combo is situated on a backstreet a few blocks away from the beach. Though similar in price to most of the other budget accommodation, Hotel Amalur is newer and cleaner than the majority of the competition. The rooms are immaculate and comfortable and there is an abundance of social spaces including a garden courtyard as well as a rooftop terrace. The downstairs restaurant is one of the best in town and the staff is exceedingly friendly. It’s a top pick in Canoa for the price.", "A collection of Bungalows more than a hotel, this beachfront rental is on the quieter side of town at the far end of the beach. It’s about a 10 minute walk from the center, but far enough away that you won’t be bothered by the noise coming from the beach bars. The quality of the cabins is on par with other, more expensive Hosteria’s in the area, but the price is cheaper. The hammocks in the back garden make for a perfect place to relax with a book.", "Guayaquil is a town in which splurging on a solid mid-range option isn’t a bad idea. La Fontana is in a wonderful location, close to the Malecon and all the central bars and restaurants. The rooms are comfortable and, though more expensive than most budget options, it won’t break the bank."]

The dorms are open, airy affairs, and the private rooms are colorful and full of character. Night-time noise can be a little bit of an issue especially if your room empties out into the courtyard. That being said the convivial atmosphere and clean facilities make for a comfortable stay.", "Another fantastic, albeit busy budget option in central Cuenca, La Cigale is a beautiful Hostal with a lively atmosphere. The restaurant/bar has a fantastic happy hour, meaning it’s extremely popular with Cuenca’s younger, arty crowd, so expect a little noise until at least 10/11 pm. The staff are friendly and the price can’t be beat.", "If you’re hoping for something a little more polished but still central and cheap, you could do much worse than the Selina Cuenca. It’s less bohemian-backpacker and a little more hipster-flashpacker. The rooms range in size and style so it’s easy to find something that fits your budget as well as your aesthetic."]
