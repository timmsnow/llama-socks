    "texts": ["Ring the buzzer at the bottom of the stairs to be let up to this secure, if a little quirky B and B guesthouse in central Bukit Bintang. It’s actually pretty quiet despite the buzzy location. There are a ton of mouth-watering Indian restaurants in the immediate area and the staff here are helpful and friendly. What really sells the place is its proximity to the Alor Night Market. Only a 5 minute walk from the guesthouse, this street market is THE place to get your grub on. It’s packed with locals and tourists alike, and everyone is there to stuff their face. Hand pulled noodle soup, dumplings of every flavor, and fresh seafood with pureed sambal, this is what life it about. You can stay at the Orange Pekoe for $15-30 depending on your room type.", "Cheap and cheerful, the Explorer’s Guesthouse has all the usual amenities you might find in a budget backpackers, like a self catering kitchen, clean ensuite rooms, and a roof-top terrace. It’s located in the China Town area of Kuala Lumpur near the famous Petaling street market. The market can get a little chaotic, but there are some damn good eats around here and it’ll give you a fresh perspective on Kuala Lumpur if you’ve been holed up in Bukit Bintang too long."]

    "texts": ["Perhaps one of my favorite places in all of Malaysia, Tampat Do Aman is a “jungle camp” run by a Borneo-British couple who have dedicated their lives to creating a beautiful space that honors the traditions of the local Rungus people of North Borneo. Despite it’s remote location at the tip of Borneo, and agrarian atmosphere, the grounds are well looked after and have a wide range of accommodation for budgets of all kinds. The private chalets are the premium option, with ensuite bathrooms, 24 hour electricity, comfortable beds, and charming decor. There are also dormitory style “longhouses” and smaller, simpler private huts for people wanting to save some ringgit. Volunteering to help develop the grounds is an option and a few hours of work a day can get you free accommodation in this magical place. The owners have a restaurant on the beach that is reasonably priced and delicious. It’s about a 20 minute walk away or you can hop in the back of their truck bed and whiz your way there in minutes. Keep an eye out for the elusive slow loris that roams the canopy at night. There’s also a cat named “Kitler” that’ll ask you for breakfast, rather impolitely, but he’s a good guy deep down.", "If you are planning on going to Sipidan, or just want to hang out on Mabul for a few days, Billabong is a fantastic collection of stilt houses set atop some pretty impossibly-turquoise waters. Of all the scuba operators I spoke to on Mabul, (and I spoke to A LOT of them), Billabong was the most willing to work with my schedule, and meet me in the middle when it came to price. So many of the operators are run like scuba-summer camps, revolving doors of divers and diving permits. Billabong was different. Cute, though definitely rustic bungalows, and a beautiful open air dining area perfectly positioned to catch the famous fiery sunsets of Borneo. The food, which is included in the package cost far exceeded my expectations and the staff couldn’t be friendlier and more accommodating."]

    "texts": ["The 80’s Guesthouse is a very backpackery-type of accommodation in a very back-packery area of a pretty back-packery town. You take the good and the bad with that. The guests are young, and social. The hotel is at the quiet end of an otherwise loud street, “The Strip” for backpackers wanting to hang out and get drunk with other backpackers who want to hang out and get drunk. But the building itself is adorable and the neighborhood is centrally located, so you can walk to just about everywhere you need to go in Georgetown. There is a coin-operated laundromat around the corner, and the hotel really scores points for the rain shower. It was a blessing after the Jungles of Sumatra.", "This isn’t actually located in Penang, but a bit north on the island of Langkawi. It’s right off the beach in Cenang and delivers the trifecta: clean, cheap, and QUIET accommodation. While the place isn’t remarkable in any particular sense, the staff are nice and it doesn’t attract the noisy backpacker set that you find at just about all the other surrounding budget hotels. A good pick if you want to be central, and party-adjacent, without being kept up by noisy neighbors. Visit their website here."]
