We’ll keep it mostly positive, but I’m just looking out for ya, ya know?"]

    "texts": ["Finding the Seascape Resort on the north coast of this magical little gem of an island was the feather in an already wildly flamboyant flopper of a hat. The self-contained bamboo cottages are mere steps from the beautiful, volcanic, black sand beach, and a short moped ride away from the departure point for your day trip to White Island. Every member of the staff goes out of their way to make sure that you’re well taken care of, and you can taste their commitment to the cause in the mango pancakes they make you for breakfast. It’s about $7 a night to sleep here, and there are a surprising amount of delightful restaurants within walking distance. The fresh-fish Kinilaw prepared in their on-site restaurant was the best meal I ate in my entire time in the Philippines, and to round it all out, there are hot springs with 24 hour access a short distance from the compound. Seriously, give me my visa, I’m ready to move. The info on their Facebook page is pretty limited, but here it is anyway.", "This place is one of those adorable little hideaways where you end up on a remote beach with nothing to do but smile inwardly while everyone around you makes pleasant, non-obtrusive conversation and nothing bad happens ever. Except that they were full, so I had to stay at the place next door. Which was meh. Fortunately the Finnish couple running 1 Peace were extremely welcoming and invited me over for dinner and general hangs during my down time, which was all the time. Set right on a beautiful south facing pink beach, it would be easy to end up spending half your trip there. They have nightly communal dinners, which are cooked beautifully, and a sprawling compound with plenty of room to chill out and remove yourself if you want quiet time. The owners are consummate hosts and go out of their way to make sure you have everything you need. Facebook page here.", "For something truly, truly unique, head to this remote outpost. Long beach is, well, extremely long, and there are only a handful of hotels and guesthouses set up to receive people. Turublien is run by a small, but extremely enthusiastic and friendly staff who do it all for you: the cooking, the cleaning, the karaoke-ing…. You feel a million miles away from civilization here as you have kilometers on end of empty beach running on either side from the hotel. It’s extremely remote, but not remote enough that you won’t be able to get a cold beer, which they make sure to stock when they get their daily moped delivery. The rooms themselves are on the other side of a fresh water canal, which you have to pull yourself across on a floating pontoon boat. This is wild beach Palawan land, so it can be a little buggy, bring mosquito repellent.", "Before we discovered little Turublien down below, we first stumbled into the Peace and Love Hotel. It had been a long day of semi-traumatic experiences involving an angry man with a machete and (thankfully) a police escort, and the wood-fired pizza they were serving up was greatly welcomed. Typically I shy away from the higher-end resorts but this place was actually really affordable for the quality of the rooms. The view overlooking the bay and surrounding islands was incredible and made for perfect sundowner material, so perfect that I have to admit… there may have been a selfie situation in the infinity pool.

    "texts": ["Mary’s homestay is tucked away into an admittedly adorable little village behind the beach front of Apo Island’s main port. It looked like the perfect solution to an unanticipated shortage of budget accommodation. We arrived early and met good old Mary, who told us that she had 2 rooms available, and she would be happy to give them to us just as soon as they were cleaned. Happily, we left our bags with her and bounded off to check out our diving prospects with the local dive shops. When we returned that evening, she informed us that actually, she had given one of our rooms away and offered us the floor to sleep on. So there was that. The fish dinner had been prepared at around 10 am so was chilled, slippery, and… aromatic by the time we got around to taking our requisite bite and a half. But the real fun began at bed time. All around Mary’s house there were hundreds, HUNDREDS, of champion cock-fighting roosters… all in cages, forced to smell each other… and so, little by little the cacophony began. Hours went by and countless murderous thoughts of rooster death flickered through my head as we all tossed mercilessly on Mary’s roughened, wood-plank floor. Spend the extra $10, stay at Liberties, and book in advance.", "Unfortunately, the guy running Marley’s was an opportunist who jumped on an unlocked door and a wallet left on our bed when I went to the bathroom. His claim, when we found him outside of our bedroom, was that someone broke in through the side door, creeped silently up the stairs to our room, and then vanished without a trace. At 5:30 in the morning and all within 45 seconds. Can’t argue with that logic."]
