For the most part, you can easily show up in town with nothing booked and find a clean, comfortable, and affordable place to stay within minutes. Most hotels in Kathmandu offer some kind of optional airport pick-up service. This can aid you in avoiding the mob of over-eager taxi drivers that await you at the airport exit."]

    "texts": ["Karma Travelers is a great place to drop your bags when you first arrive in Kathmandu. They have a cheap airport pick-up service, friendly staff, and an on-site tour agency that can help you book your bus or a tour if you’s rather not schlub it around town. The rooms here are clean, have balconies overlooking the colorful streets below, and the hotel is in a quieter part of Thamel on a street that gets less traffic than most. The price is definitely right here and the hotel will hold your bags for you if you want to take the local bus to Bhaktupur or Nagarkot.", "This gem is tucked into a quiet alleyway, right next to Rosemary Kitchen and Coffee shop, which happens to have the best damn latte in all of Kathmandu (the full breakfast ain’t bad either!). Yala Peak has very clean rooms, is one of the cheaper options in town, and the staff couldn’t be friendlier. It’s in a more central location than Karma Travelers, and the proximity to Rosemary’s, along with other fantastic restaurants and shops, really sells the place."]

    "texts": ["There is a smattering of budget hotels on Gauri Ghat rd in the Lakeside neighborhood that all have more or less the same vibe. Solid ensuite rooms with balconies and rooftop views of the stunning Annapurna backdrop. I ended up staying at the Rising Moon because it is run by an extremely sweet woman who is more than happy to make your stay as comfortable as possible. It’s on the quiet side of town, out of the range of the noise from the bars that line the main drag, and Rising Moon will hold your bags for you while you go trekking. The prices online are notably higher than what you will get if you just show up in person ready to make a deal.", "Lakeside is a backpackers mecca, even among the one billion and 20 budget hotels and hostels that exist in Pokhara. This particular place is great because it organizes tours like paragliding for cheaper than what you would find with the other tour agencies in the area. There is an on-site restaurant serving mostly western food, but there are a million great Nepalese restaurants in the vicinity as well. If you are looking for a more social environment this could be the place for you. Did I mention the dorm rooms are $3 a night? There’s no website but you can book through Hostelworld or just show up."]

    "texts": ["Accommodation along the trails tends to be many shades of the same color. “Tea houses” are the full-service accommodations that line the mountain paths of Nepal. Every few kilometers along the path you can encounter a small town where you can rest, eat a meal, and if you feel like it, get a room. If you are traveling with an agency your accommodation will be booked for you in advance, but if you are hoofing it on your own you will just have to find a place when you arrive. The benefit to this is that you can go at your own pace. Even outside of the towns you will find the odd road-side tea house, who would be more than happy to put you up for the night. Rooms are really cheap up here. Don’t expect much more than a bed and 4 walls, but for $3 or less who cares? The general idea is that you will be eating your meals with them as well, and if you eat both dinner and breakfast with them, you can often score the room for free.\n\nThe tea houses are mostly the same but there are some differences to look out for. Some will have hot water included, while others will charge for it. Some are more social than others, but for the most part they will all have a gathering place and a fire pit where weary trekkers can warm themselves and recuperate from the days hike. If you want to get the room with the best view, start hiking early. The earlier you arrive in town the more options you have, and there are some pretty sweet views indeed."]
