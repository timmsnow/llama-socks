Due to the fact that a decent percentage of the budget places aren’t online, it can be worth it to spend some time shopping around when you get there. The difference between a good budget experience and a horrific budget experience can only really be assessed in person.\n\nIf you are a serial planner and leaving the booking open is going to give you heart palpitations, here are a few options to mull over. With a few exceptions, these are all mid-range budget options."]

    "texts": ["If you want to be want to be in the middle of the madness, staying on Khao San rd is a backpacker rite of passage. Though it has changed over the years from a banana-pancake hippie side street to… whatever the shit you call that now, it is a reliable area for travelers wanting to meet other travelers and throw back a few.. million beers. The streets are lined with shops and travel agencies, making it easy to process visas and buy bus tickets. Essentially, it’s a one stop shop. There are about a million hotels that are varying degrees of MEH, and there’s really no need to book in advance if this is the area you want to stay in, but the D and D stands out for having a roof top pool, air conditioned rooms and comfortable beds. It’s quieter than some of the hotels on the strip, but still pretty affordable.", "The Silom Village Inn is, you guessed it, cozily situated in Silom. This area is big on nightlife and it could be a good move to base yourself here if you have any interest in checking out the scene. This 3 star hotel is cute and tidy and has all the amenities a weary traveler might be missing. Rooms start around $27 USD for a double."]

    "texts": ["We stumbled into this place right off the boat from Surathani and managed to score a double room with a fan and a balcony for 400 baht (about $12). The complex itself has the feel of a luxury spot, situated right at the top of a cliff overlooking a picture-perfect white sand beach. There are bungalows on offer that range from budget to luxury. Everything is clean, there is an on-site restaurant, and the hotel next door rents motorbikes should you want one. This side of the island is peaceful, idyllic, and far away from any sort of full moon shenanigans. There are beautiful beaches everywhere you look and this hotel just so happens to be right across the street from a delicious MU-KRATHA (thai bbq) place. Doesn’t get any better.", "This place is a little pricier than my usual budget (like $25-30 a night) but they often give big discounts online (alternatively you can try in person as well). The complex consists of adorable adobe-huts with a central swimming pool (if you’re into that kind of thing). There is an on-site restaurant and friendly service. The beach is an arms length away and the sunsets here are epic. There are a good number of relatively budget-friendly hotels on this stretch of the island, so feel free to have a poke around and see whats on offer elsewhere."]

    "texts": ["June Horizon is ADORABLE. The owner, June, is a colorful soul who flits about the premises leaving touches of enthusiasm wherever she goes. The compound itself is an on-going art project with a comfortable, laid-back vibe to it. It’s situated at the far end of the beach, so it’s relaxed and quiet. The bungalows have outdoor showers and an open, airy feel. There is a restaurant and the beach is right at your doorstep. Bring an extra flashlight. Things get dark after sun-down. There is no website, just rock up.", "Outside of Tonsai beach, this is really THE ONLY budget accommodation in the Railay area. It’s pretty adorable though, tucked into the back of town on a moderately maintained compound, with a woodsy sort of feel. The bungalows are very rustic and can be as cheap as 200 baht ($6) in the low season. This means you don’t have a bathroom sink or an electric outlet in your cabin, but the front desk will charge your electronics for you while you go traipsing about and chances are you’ll have some neighborly visits from the various animals living on the property (awww). You can hike to Tonsai over the hills behind the compound, or walk to the main beaches by following the path down the hill. At night all is quiet in Railay, and being up here is a different world from the busy beaches down below. There isn’t a website, you should be able to secure a room if you show up early and it isn’t high season, or a holiday. If it is booked up, a 20 minute jaunt over the hill to Tonsai beach will get you into budget backpacker land. Expect a lot of dreadlocks."]

There is a good deal of information about the activities in the surrounding countryside and they can help you rent mopeds if you want to give it a go on your own. You WILL be visited by monkeys, who may or may not watch you while you use the toilet.", "This place is centrally located, very cheap, and has the friendliest hotel owner in Thailand. This is simple, basic, budget accommodation. I am not recommending this to people who want luxury. But for a dusty backpacker, who wants to sleep off the night bus hangover and wants a cheap room with AC, this will work.", "If you want it cheap and cheerful, this is the place. Everything is a short walk in Pai so it doesn’t really matter where you stay. Most of the budget places to stay in Pai have similar layouts, so again, have a poke around and see whats on offer. It is easy to find a decent bed for insanely cheap."]
