The major cities and tourist spots will have a lot of accommodation options, but the good ones tend to be quite expensive. Most hotels are either flashy, all-inclusives that shelter the western tourist from the realities of the continent, or they are budget hotels for African businessmen, unaccustomed to dealing with the expectations of wealthy western tourists.\n\nFinding a place to sleep in the rurals of Tanzania can be a bit of an endeavor, and if you’re venturing off the beaten path at all prepare to either spend more, or settle for less. Maybe a good rule of thumb to follow would be, if you have a shower, use it, because it could be awhile until you meet another one that doesn’t come in the form of a bucket. That being said, you’ll rarely be spending more than $10 a night for a room. As long as the room has a door, and the door has a lock, well, you’re in Africa so, what more do you really need?\n\nMidrange options in Tanzania are few and far between, but I will outline a few of the good ones I’ve found here."]

    "texts": ["Zanzibar is one of the few places in Tanzania that has a really fantastic range of accommodation options. There are definitely plenty of high end, luxury hotels here, so take your pick. Paje Beach on the East Coast is primarily a kite surfing destination, and has been steadily gaining in popularity, however, it seems to have the best budget beach options and maintains a familiar backpacker vibe. In Stone Town, it’s very easy to walk around and find a solid budget option. In fact, there are plenty of people who will offer you help in this endeavor. Truly, help isn’t needed, as you can knock on just about any budget hotel and find what you need for a reasonable price. Let the “helpers” know you are ok, be polite, and generally they will move on.", "New Teddy’s is the reincarnation of… (Old) Teddy’s and sits directly on Paje Beach facing the brilliant cerulean sea. The bungalows all have sand floors, which at first seems like a turn off but then kind of grows on you. Teddy’s is one of the last guesthouse complexes on Paje on the southern side of the beach, and so it feels slightly more remote and (generally) more relaxed than some of the other spots. There are plenty of lounge-y areas and a pool for when the tide is way way way way out, as is want to happen from time to time.", "Kiponda is a great place to base yourself in Stone Town. Because it’s a small town and pretty much everything is close, just about everywhere you stay will be walkable, but Kiponda is nice because it’s close to the night market, which when the streets are dark can be a little harder to navigate to from far away. The rooms here are very comfortable, the staff is friendly, and there is an airport pick-up service available for people arriving late. The website says rates range from $35-45 USD per night, but online deals are common and you should be able to secure a room for about 30% less. Chances are you can probably negotiate a lower rate in person if you haven’t booked. Especially in low season."]

    "texts": ["Finding good accommodation by Lake Tanganyika isn’t the easiest task. There are only a few towns that are on the “highway” that more or less follows the lake. Kigoma is by far the best place for accessing the Lake and there are a couple of pleasant guesthouse options.", "This adorable collection of tent-houses come bungalows exists on the outskirts of town on a hillside property that slowly tumbles it’s way down to the crystaline expanse of the lake. Since most of the lakeside accommodation in the area is near town, and in town the lake is used for commerce, this hotel’s slightly out-of-town location really adds to the peaceful atmosphere. The little curve of beach is pretty much completely private and the lake views are stunning. The main guesthouse, located in the center of the complex has most of the western amenities you would expect. Budget travelers will be finding their way to the tent-bungalows further down the path along the hillside. You’re pretty much in the African wilderness here, and it will feel like it. Bring bug spray. This is self-catering accommodation, and being that it’s out of town, make sure you prepare for it. Also, it gets DARK at night. Bring a headlamp with you if you would like to see anything after 6 pm.", "Pretty much the exact opposite of the Jakobson Beach house, Kigoma Hilltop is the luxury alternative for those visiting lake Tanganyika. It has dramatic and beautiful sweeping views of the Lake, and is tucked into a corner of Kigoma that’s just isolated enough to be peaceful. It feels a bit removed from the country surrounding it, but if you haven’t had a shower in awhile and you need to recover from an 18 hour bus ride, this would be a beautiful present to give yourself."]

There’s a tour operators desk where you can inquire about safaris etc, although I recommend shopping around town since everyone here is a tour operator. The halls are dimly lit, and theres a mildly depressing feel to the building, but if you’re only here for a night or two it’s extremely convenient and wonderfully cheap. Breakfast is included.", "This hotel is located a bit outside of the city center, but still within walking distance (about 1.5 k). It’s a good mid-range option and you should be able to get a good deal for your room if you exercise your negotiation skills a little bit. There is a pool, which is wonderful way to end your day in a town that’s as physically and mentally draining as Arusha. While it isn’t sparkly, the rooms are clean and the staff is nice. Breakfast buffet is included. View website here."]

There are TONS of good accommodation options here and the town itself is a very pleasant place to spend a few days, even if you aren’t tackling the ice-capped giant that dominates the skyline.", "This place is ADORABLE. It’s got that kind of nature-meets-modernity feel that puts a traveler right at home. There is an obvious intention to be eco-friendly here that could stem from the amazing views of Kilimanjaro, a reminder of whats good about being green. The staff here is extremely friendly and knowledgable. Breakfast is small, but the views from where you eat it are something you will not soon forget. At Mountain Bike, prices are consistent with other budget stays in the area, but the quality here is higher than most. A great place to meet others and plan the next leg of your trip.", "This hotel FEELS like luxury, but it’s actually a low-cost midrange option dressed up in shiny new clothes. The little rondavel-style huts are cute as a button and the whole property has a relaxing vibe that’s extremely rare in budget hotels in Tanzania. The rooms are well decorated and maintained, and the garden (you knew there would be a garden) is a great place to relax in a hammock and read a book. There is an onsite restaurant with ok food, but it isn’t too far from the main drag that you can’t pop into town for dinner and drinks if you prefer. A solid mid-range option. Enjoy it while you can."]
