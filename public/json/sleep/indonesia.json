Having little interest in the latter, I am focusing more on budget-friendly accommodation here. As a general rule, if you’re flexible with where you want to stay, you shouldn’t need to reserve in advance, although holidays and busier locations like Bali are exceptions. It is always a good idea to reserve in advance if arriving after dark."]

    "texts": ["Not only are the staff at Green Hill exceedingly friendly, they also cook up some of the best damn Beef Rendang this side of the Malacca Straits. The beautiful wood paneled huts sit high in the tree tops, affording you views of the surrounding canopy (and all that dwell there) and do not lack in comfort. The ensuite rooms have gigantic stone bathrooms with bamboo showers, and a decent sized balcony for evening beer-sipping, and the never-ending stream of adorable house-kittens will melt your travel-weary heart.", "Even if you aren’t here to dive, Lumba Lumba offers fantastic beach front accommodation on Palau Weh’s enchantingly serene Gapang beach. Choose between self-contained ensuite cabins, privates with shared bathrooms, and even dorm room accommodation. The restaurant next door doesn’t disappoint.", "Situated right on the lake, Tabo Cottages _feels_ luxurious, but it’s actually quite reasonably priced. There is a traditional batik platform-house for commanding views of the surrounding crater lake, perfectly situated to house anyone preparing to go on a “magical fungal journey”, which the staff are happy to help facilitate."]

    "texts": ["There are about a million hotels in Jakarta that offer a comfortable room at a decent price, so really the best thing to do is decide the area you prefer and pick something close. I enjoyed staying at the Hotel Neo because it has easy access to the transit system, (Block M station), and it is surrounded by some very decent, well priced restaurants. The hotel itself isn’t a revelation, but it’s clean, comfortable, and air conditioned.", "Via Via guesthouse in Yogyakarta is a super comfortable little oasis nestled in the backpacker neighborhood of Prawirotaman. With a nice garden outfitted with a plunge pool and lounge area, it’s a good place to unwind after a dusty day in the big city. Everyone is nice and accommodating and the neighborhood is great for travelers on foot. Restaurants and bars abound, so it is an easy place to meet other travelers and have a good night out in Yogyakarta."]

Upon making your way to Wakai, the main hub of the islands you will be met by Kadidiri’s private transport boat and whisked away to the sweetest of paradisiacal locales. Perfect white sand, private beaches, hidden coves, and a long, wood-plank pier to dangle your feet over as you enjoy your sundowner from the fully stocked tiki bar. Kadidiri gets points for having great food (which is included in the price of your stay), and a wonderful, laid back vibe. You may want to consider bringing some snacks if you have a high metabolism, as the meal schedule is sacrosanct. There is an onsite dive center and they also organize boat trips to other islands. Be careful, as the boats are tiny, and some boat captains don’t always prioritize safety.", "On the far side of the island of Melange, lies the beautiful beach “resort” of Sera Beach. These cottages are well maintained, and the nicest of the three options that line the coast. The food is included and the meals are well cooked. If you can brave a walk in the dark and aren’t particularly affected by vertigo, the locals will take you up the cliff to find the gigantic and moderately terrifying coconut crabs that inhabit the woodlands in the surrounding area. FUN!"]

The owners are friendly and can make you a plate of mie goreng if you get in after dinner time. Though it is a bit of a hike out of town, the bungalows are cheap and well maintained, and the owners keep a collection of motorbikes ready to go, should you want to rent one. Being that they are the best way to see all of what Kuta has to offer, it is definitely recommended. There are some cute restaurants on the main road and a market nearby as well.", "There are tons of places to stay on the Gili Islands. Trawangan is the biggest, most well known, and generally more riotous of the three. Gili Air is also popular, with a slightly more laid back feel, and Gili Meno is the quietest, though generally understood to be more expensive with a couples-only vibe. I stayed on Gili Air and honestly enjoyed the bungalows I stayed in, however they were identical to all of the other ones lining the north beach of the island. The best way to approach accommodation in the Gili’s is to walk to the beach, and ask around for the cheapest price. They know you are coming, and so do all the neighbors. With not much variety in terms of bungalow quality, you will get a better price shopping around."]
