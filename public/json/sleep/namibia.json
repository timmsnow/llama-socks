    "texts": ["Finding a good place to sleep in Namibia involves sifting through the plethora of over-the-top expensive desert lodges and safari camps and finding something that’s comfortably in your budget, safe, and has all the facilities you need. Because 90% of Namibia is basically a vast expanse of land devoid of people, getting things like electricity and running water can be challenging, and often pricey. The cities are fairly easy to navigate in terms of budget accommodation and most places are accustomed to foreign travelers and have all the creature comforts you may be looking for. Outside of the cities though, it can get bleak.\n\nMy advice is to try to be as prepared as possible for this. Most 4×4’s will come with camping gear. If refrigeration and cooking gas can be included for an extra cost, get it. Many campgrounds won’t have restaurants or cooking facilities so make sure you have everything you need before heading out into the wilderness. Free camping in the desert is an adventure that should be reserved for situations in which there is no official campsite nearby, and for those who have a lot of experience in the bush, the smarter alternative is to stay in official campsites which leave no question about the legality or safety of your stay on the property.\n\nIf you prepare yourself and stockpile your supplies, you can count on an unforgettable experience and give the finger to those 5 -star, over-priced safari lodges at the same time."]

    "texts": ["This backpackers is conveniently located in the center of Windhoek in walking distance of pretty much everything. They have a range of budget options from dorm rooms to privates, to on-site camping. If you don’t have your own tent, they can provide one for you. It has a social atmosphere, so this is a great place to meet other travelers if you are planning on expanding your party for a desert excursion. OH, and there’s a pool, SCORE. Dorms start at N220, privates N500", "Swakopmund is a small town and fairly easy to navigate, so even though Skeleton Beach is just a bit out of the center it makes for a nice place to hunker down after a trip to the desert. The beach side location is calming and the facilities are super clean. Throw in a helpful staff and a free breakfast and you have everything you need. Dorms start at N190, private double ensuite N650.", "If you’ve been wandering in the desert for 2 weeks and want a good place to recover, Prost Hotel, is worth the extra few bucks. It’s super central, clean, has a great breakfast, and spa-like bathrooms to get the desert stink off of you. The single rooms go for N950 including breakfast, but online deals can cut that number in half."]

    "texts": ["Desert Lodges in Namibia are crazy expensive. For budget travelers I really recommend getting a 4×4 with camp gear and self-catering your way across the Kalahari. Here are some places I found to pull over on the side of the road and set up camp. Sometimes free camping is possible, but it’s not necessarily a safe option. Additionally, if you’re planning on being in the desert awhile it may not be a bad idea to find a place to shower every now in then. Your travel companions will thank you.", "In a world of perpetual gray it is hard to know in all certainty what is “right” and what is not. The owner of Otjutotngwe has been looking after cheetahs in the area for about 24 years. This means previously wild animals have been domesticated and are looked after and fed on his property. Many may take issue with this but the truth is if the cheetahs were not there, they would be in grave danger of being killed by humans in the wild. There is a sort of epidemic of cheetah slayings in Namibia, mostly by herders looking after their livestock. This is not a problem with an easy answer. I found it helpful to visit with an open mind, and do my best to learn about the situation rather than judge it off-hand. The lodge itself is a welcome respite in the middle of nowhere, and at the very least, an education in the problems plaguing that noble feline, the cheetah. Camping is cheap.", "Near Keetmanshoop is this little desert lodge. While most of the accommodation is expensive, luxury-style safari tents, they do allow for self catering campers to stay and use the facilities. This means you can score a shower and charge up your electronics for about N150 a night. The grounds themselves are nice and you can explore the are which includes the quiver tree forest and the dolerite rock formations of the Giants Playground. Makes for an interesting stop."]

There is an on-site communal kitchen for self-caterers and even a little kiosk selling drinks and light meals. In an area where budget accommodation is few and far between this is a great option at N350 per person per night.", "Ok. This place is swanky, but to be honest, most of the safari lodges are and this one is actually cheaper than most of the other ones and offers the same standard of facilities. The restaurant is of the usual buffet variety, and the rooms are all clean and comfortable with ensuite bathrooms. The watering hole viewing platforms give you an introduction to this incredible park with stunning displays of animal activity. Everybody from the zebra to the black rhino comes out to play here. Sunset is a particularly compelling time to take a peek. A double room comes in at N900 per person.", "Moping Village Lodge is an affordable option just outside the national park boundary. This won’t be the same experience as staying INSIDE the park, but the facilities are good, if a little basic, and there is even a swimming pool. The price is right and you can find good deals online. Camping is available as well as private rooms.", "If you spend any time in the Caprivi Strip, or if you are heading to Zambia via the Wenela Border Post, absolutely make a stop for the night at the Caprivi Mutoya Lodge. Situated right on the Zambezi River, this little slice of heaven has everything you need to recharge your batteries. There is a range of accommodation options, from camping to luxury chalets (we loved the brand new budget safari tents!) and some incredible views and lovely food to be had from the onsite bar/restaurant. The staff is incredibly friendly, and will go out of their way to help you with whatever you need. Seriously, above and beyond."]
