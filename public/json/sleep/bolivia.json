A lot of hotels and guesthouses aren’t listed on the online booking sites, and Bolivia is a country where it is still possible to show up in a new town and shop around for your hotel room.\n\nThat being said, during high season the best options book up quick, so if you have a particular place in mind, make sure to go ahead and seal the deal."]

    "texts": ["Hostal Sonia is a little bit of a walk up the hill from the the bus station, but not too far out of the center to be inconvenient, plus the small gains in elevation pay you back in spades with the excellent views of the lake that you can take in from the Hostel rooftop. The Hostel has affordable singles, doubles, and dorms and breakfast is included in the price of the room. The entire building is well looked after, and the friendly staff is more than happy to hold your bags for you after check-out if you’re thinking about making a trip to las islas. All that, tied in with a hot water shower, and you’ve got yourself a great budget option.", "There are a TON of budget options for those wishing to spend the night on Isla Del Sol (and you should). The truth of the matter is that the best way to find the right place for you could be to just show up and have a look around. There are many wonderful guesthouses that aren’t even listed online, meaning they are more likely to be cheaper, and available. Show up on the early side of the day and you’re sure to find something that suits you in both price and location.\n\nIf you do want to book your place in advance, that’s fine, but there are a few things to consider when looking for a room. For starters, the entire island is one giant mountain, and there is a lot of climbing involved no matter where you stay. The higher up, the better views, but of course, your bags won’t carry themselves to the hotel now will they? Also, hot running water is a rarity here. If you can go without a shower, no worries, if you need one, best to check before you book. The night-time temps here are FRIGID."]

    "texts": ["Located off of Calle Sanchez Lima, a couple blocks from the Plaza Avaroa, Starshine B and B is a cute, quiet, and comfortable place to spend a few nights in La Paz. It’s run by a friendly, helpful family who live on-site, but maintain their distance out of respect for guests privacy. The B and B is comprised of two buildings. The rooms in the building on the south side of the street seem newer, have fantastic views and get a lot of light. The surrounding neighborhood is safe and surprisingly hip. It’s a pleasant and quiet neighborhood to base yourself in. It’s about 700 m from the Sopocachi Teleferico Station.", "Just a bit north of the Starshine, El Prado is situated close to Sucre Plaza and is brand new. It’s modeled after the capsule hotels of Japan, with small compartments for solo travelers outfitted with personal TV’s, lighting, and electrical outlets. There are dormitory-style rooms with six to twelve capsules, or you can opt for private rooms containing 2 capsules only. The facilities are extremely modern and kind of adorable. It’s very centrally located, modern, and breakfast is included."]

    "texts": ["As far as budget accommodation goes in Uyuni, there is a good deal of “meh” going around. Part of the issue is that Uyuni is a small town, with a HUGE amount of tourist traffic going through it, mostly for one night only, meaning standards only have to be as high as they HAVE to be. Don’t expect anything exceptional from a budget hotel here, and more than likely you’ll pay a little more than you might think it’s worth.", "With not a ton of great budget options around, Le Ciel is a decent choice for those overnighting in Uyuni. The hotel is excellently located a block away from both the bus and train stations, with free wifi and breakfast included in the rates. The rooms have heaters and they don’t skimp on the blankets, like some of their competitors.", "So, Uyuni is one of those towns where you may want to consider splashing out a little extra for an upgrade on your hotel. It’s not that the budget hotels are SO bad in Uyuni, but more that you’re likely either starting a three-day trip into the Salar, or you have just FINISHED a three-day trip into the Salar, and either way you’re probably going to want a good, hot shower, and a really nice sleep. Nativa can provide you these things. It’s one of the few hotels in Uyuni with an eye for aesthetics and all of the rooms are outfitted with seriously comfortable beds. To set you up for the day, there is a big buffet breakfast included in the price, which is only a little higher than the budget options, and totally worth it. You can find them on facebook here."]
