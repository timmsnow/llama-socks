    "texts": ["Finding a good place to sleep in Botswana involves sifting through the plethora of over-the-top expensive desert lodges and safari camps and finding something that’s comfortably in your budget, safe, and has all the facilities you need. Because 90% of Botswana is basically a vast expanse of land devoid of people, getting things like electricity and running water can be challenging, and often pricey. The cities are fairly easy to navigate in terms of midrange accommodation and most places are accustomed to foreign travelers and have all the creature comforts you may be looking for. Outside of the cities though, it can get bleak. Long stretches of the country have little to no accommodation to speak of. It’s best to have your accommodation plans sorted before you arrive.\n\nMy advice is to try to mix camping with mid-range lodges. Camp when in the remote areas and take advantage of the midrange lodges while making re-fueling stops near a city. Allowing yourself the occasional sleep in a cushy bed and a meal in a restaurant can go a long way to keeping your enthusiasm for bush camping intact.\n\nMost 4×4’s will come with camping gear. If refrigeration and cooking gas can be included for an extra cost, get it. Many campgrounds offer little more than a pit toilet, meaning you need to be completely self-reliant. This means no restaurants or cooking facilities so make sure you have everything you need before heading out into the wilderness.\n\nIf you prepare yourself and stockpile your supplies, you can count on an unforgettable experience and give the finger to those 5 -star, over-priced safari lodges at the same time."]

    "texts": ["Old Bridge is an extremely welcoming little lodge situated right next to the Maun river. Although water levels vary throughout the year it is not uncommon for crocodiles to hang out in the water just below the lodge, which is why you’ll see protective wire fencing lining the perimeter. The lodge itself consists of cute canvas private rooms, a few of which have nice outdoor en-suites with good water pressure, a mixed dorm, and a small area for those looking to pitch a tent. The staff here couldn’t be friendlier, and they can organize trips into the delta, Moremi, Chobe, or the nearby Makgadigadi Pans for those traveling without wheels. The onsite restaurant is a popular hangout for locals as well as people passing through town, so be ready for a mildly social atmosphere. This is a great place to park it if you need a couple days to restock your supplies before heading out into the wild. If you need to get laundry done, consider holding off on washing your whites, as the water here is a silty, muddy, rusty affair.", "Located just a bit outside of Gaborone proper, this lodge and campsite offers a range of accommodation away from the noise of the capital city. The grounds are peaceful, and there’s a swimming pool and bar area for chill times. The chalets are comfortable and reasonably priced. While this option is best for those who have their own transport, the hotel does offer an airport shuttle service."]

    "texts": ["In Botswana you will encounter some truly magical campsites. In recent years Botswana has transitioned a good number of the government run campsites to private ownership. This means for starters, they are more expensive, but also that they tend to be well maintained and some may even have onsite attendants staying nearby. While the majority of the campsites are pretty spartan, the location of these specific campsites will make for a lovely and memorable stay.", "Of the four campsites situated at Kori near the Matswere Gate, #2 is by far the most handsome. This site has a ton of shade, and the ratio of open space to tree coverage is just about perfect for a cozy camp. There is a pit toilet, and a “shower room”, though you’ll need to supply the water. Kori Campsite #4 is a close second.", "Savuti Camp is run by the SKL group, and while the camping fees are some of the highest in the country ($50 pp/pn!), you’ll find they run an excellent campground. The ablution blocks are clean, with great water-pressure and have recently been “elephant proofed” so you can do your thing in peace. There are a number of campsites in Savuti Camp, but “Paradise Camp” is our favorite. It sits on a ridge overlooking a (dry) riverbed and offers fantastic views of the scenery and sunset.", "The Khwai Community Trust runs these campsites out of the Khwai village. While they are not technically in a national park, the remote location means you will be surrounded by animals during your stay here. Think: herds of elephant, wandering hippos, and roaring lions. It’s the real deal and will have you feeling extremely… exposed, in the best way. Make your reservations in advance, and don’t be put off if you can’t seem to find “reception”. They’ll find you eventually."]

    "texts": ["While I encourage you to take advantage of the amazing camping opportunities in Botswana, occasionally it can be nice to eat in a restaurant ot sleep in a bed. Most lodges are UBER-luxury and prohibitively expensive, but I have a few recommendations for midrange lodges that may not be situated on prime real estate, but offer comfort at an affordable cost.", "Tautona Lodge is about 5 kilometers outside of the town of Ghanzi, which is a great re-fueling stop if you’re heading up the west side highway or have just completed a trip through the CKGR. The lodge grounds are expansive and offer a range of options from luxury chalets to ensuite safari tents and camping. It’s wonderfully affordable and has an onsite restaurant with local and western food options. There’s a swimming pool as well if you’re itching for a splash.", "Driving into Kwa Nokeng is not a romantic affair. The lodge sits on the Limpopo river, on Botswanan side of the border immediately after crossing from South Africa at Martins Drift. While you might feel a little odd spending the night behind a petrol station on the side of the highway, the location is extremely convenient for those splitting up a long drive to/from Johannesburg. There is an onsite restaurant, a pool, and the aforementioned petrol station to stock up on gas before you leave. The chalets here over look the Limpopo river and all have full kitchens for those wanting to self-cater. It won’t be your most memorable night in the African bush, but logistically speaking, it’s a sight for sore eyes if you’ve been on the highway for the last 8 hours."]
