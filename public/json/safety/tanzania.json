The main thing to remember is that most of your problems can be avoided by simply respecting the natural order of where you are.\n\nDon’t mess with the animals on safari.\n\nAvoid gross displays of wealth in a country where poverty is everywhere.\n\nDon’t travel great distances at night, and keep to populated areas when walking around on your own.\n\nOutside of these staples, remember to be respectful when dealing with the police, regardless of how frustrating a situation is, maintaining a calm and polite demeanor will go along way to keeping things from escalating."]

    "texts": ["African cities in general don’t tend to be the safest and Tanzania is no exception. This is largely due to the rampant income inequality and overpopulation, which stretches the resources to the max. So many people leaving the countryside to look for work in the cities, and not enough jobs for everyone. It’s a recipe for desperation, and desperate people can get real handsy if it’s a matter of survival.", "Theft is the biggest threat here. If you don’t look like you have much on offer you’ll probably, for the most part, be in the clear. Don’t wear expensive watches, jewelry, or flaunt any electronics. Pick pockets operate in busy markets as well and thrive in the chaos of the bus stations, so keep your money close, and maybe only carry what you need for the day in your pocket. Unfortunately, children can often get roped into thievery by adults, so stay vigilant even around children.", "Violent crime is not unheard of either. The best strategy to avoid this is to stay in public places, where there are plenty of other people around, and avoid going out at night. Don’t walk around by yourself, especially after dark and take cabs if you need to go anywhere.", "Unfortunately cabs in Dar es Salaam have been known to rob tourists from time to time. Travel in a group when at all possible. Get a recommended driver’s information from your hotel, if the driver has been vouched for then you can pretty much rest easy. It may be wise to contact a hotel before you arrive and get the number for a driver just in case you arrive after dark. Both the train station AND the airport are well out of the city and you will need a taxi to get in.", "Traffic is bad in Dar, and pedestrians do not have the right of way. Be careful when walking along the crowded sidewalks and always check before crossing. You can for real get hit by a car."]

Unfortunately if you are taking public transit, there isn’t a whole lot you can do about this, except try to start your journey as early as possible. If it’s available, you can try to arrange for a pick-up from your hotel, or pre-arrange for a reliable taxi driver to come get you.", "Traveling long distances at night is a bad idea. Robberies have been known to happen, even along major roads throughout the country. If your bus is robbed, chances of your report being handled in any real capacity by the police are very very slim.", "Breakdowns happen all the time. Bring extra food for yourself in the event that you’re stranded for longer than a few hours.", "Trains can be a hotbed for theft. Keep an eye on your stuff at all times and maybe sleep with your most valuable possessions, like your passport etc. Lock the door to your cabin when possible. Traveling in a group greatly reduces your risk of being targeted."]

The first and most important rule is DON’T GET OUT OF THE CAR. There are occasional exceptions, like when you have to pee, or when your boyfriend accidentally drops your camera out the window, etc…. but unless your guide specifically tells you it’s ok, DON’T DO IT. Pretty much every animal out there can kill you and I am about 95% sure they wouldn’t even feel bad about it. Especially the hippos, they really never feel bad about it.", "Now, some of the animals are more sensitive than others. Sometimes those sensitive animals happen to be the big animals. Don’t tease or call to the wild animals, because they just might come running. and I’m telling you, a charging elephant don’t care one spit about your silly little SUV. If an elephant starts to charge, back up immediately and give them space. Their first charge is generally a warning, but better to not stick around for the second one.", "Give all the animals the right of way and they will most likely let you live. Give them the respect they deserve and they might let you get close enough to get a good picture of them eating one of their friends for lunch. Awwwww.", "The biggest threat of all is the mosquito. Malaria is a real thing here, so lotion up, and use those mozzie nets. It’s not a bad idea to wear long pants and long sleeved shirts in the early morning and evening hours."]

    "texts": ["The story of LGBT rights in Africa is to me one of the most tragic and under-reported issues of our time. Homophobic laws originally put in place by the white people have evolved into a disgusting display of unbridled bigotry that reaches all corners of the continent. It hasn’t helped that armies of badly dressed christian crusaders (mostly American Evangelicals) have taken up the Anti-gay cause with a bewildering vehemence, bewildering especially on a planet in which legitimate tragedies that require actual action occur on a daily basis and could benefit from the resources and passion that they insist on wasting on meaningless causes such as telling people who they can and can not get down with.", "Many of these Evangelical groups have raised massive sums of money which comes to Africa as aid money, but conditionally. Churches are being built, and wells are being dug, but rarely without a healthy dose of proselytizing HELLFIRE. Anti-gay rhetoric is being taught in schools and has become so deeply embedded in the national psyche of many African nations, that even though there are stirrings of reform in the air, it could take decades to undo the damage. Gay people are often targeted by the government, as well as by vigilantes.", "In Tanzania, homosexual acts are illegal and carry a maximum penalty of life in prison. LIFE people! It has happened in the past that newspapers have taken it upon themselves to publish the names and home addresses of suspected homosexuals, leading to vicious attacks and even murder. It’s a very serious situation.", "Like always, tourists are not generally affected, but I wouldn’t recommend discussing the subject of homosexuality or displaying any affection for the same sex in public. If the wrong person feels threatened, things can go south real quick. I felt generally safe, but I remained alert pretty much always.", "It’s heartbreaking that this is the state of affairs in a country with so much love to give. Don’t let this keep you from traveling to Tanzania. Your presence will only help add to the visibility of a people greatly in need of seeing some friendly faces. Even if it’s only a subtle introduction, the local LGBT population will benefit greatly from knowing there are people out there living freely."]
