    "texts": ["As far as African cities go, the cities in Botswana are not particularly problematic. People are mostly very friendly to tourists and during the day you shouldn’t have any problems walking around town. Petty crimes like theft are on the rise in all cities in Botswana however so staying vigilant is a good idea. Don’t wear any nice jewelry or carry expensive items, it’s just asking for a problem. While the majority of people in Botswana are exceedingly friendly, and problems are unlikely, the cities are the places where you’re most likely to experience desperate or threatening behavior.", "If there is a safe provided at your hotel, just use it. Avoid leaving your safari 4×4 parked on the side of the road with your anything inside. Outside of a private parking lot they will be a draw for opportunists.\n\nAlthough it’s rare, you will want to keep your doors locked at any service station to avoid any bag snatching. It’s a good idea not to walk alone at night, and even in groups it’s wise to stay in well lit areas, or just take a taxi. Muggings are rare, but they do happen.\n\nKeeping yourself aware of your surroundings should be sufficient here. The cities here are, for the most part easy and safe to navigate."]

    "texts": ["The same old general rules apply here as in the rest of Africa when you’re talking about animal safety, however keep in mind that in Botswana there are large open areas without fencing, and animals often appear in droves even outside of the National Parks.", "Don’t stick your head in that hippo’s mouth for your instagram picture. In fact, don’t even go near that hippo. Hippo’s see nothing wrong with biting your head off. Don’t approach any of the animals. Even the ones that don’t have an interest in eating you will certainly be happy enough to step on you. Elephants can be territorial. If they look like they want  you to back it up…. BACK IT UP.", "In addition to watching out for yourself, make sure to you tread lightly in their space. Some animals, especially the grazing variety can spook easy. If they feel anxious because you are getting too close, they can freak out and actually injure themselves in the process. I’ve seen a gazelle lance itself on a fence post trying to flee from an over-zealous cameraman. Let’s try to treat these guys with some respect right?", "Don’t get out of your safari vehicle. If you do need to pee, do it quickly, and make sure you’re watching the ground for snakes etc. Botswana is vast, and the chances of you making it to a hospital in time to receive any anti-venom is extremely low.", "Night is when the hunting happens. This would be a good time to get in your tent and stay there. It can get real dark real quick, and let me tell you, the animals see MUCH better in the dark than you do.\n\nIf you want to stay up for a few hours around the fire, just make sure you have a plan. Make sure your car doors are unlocked, and that it is parked directly behind you, with your fire in front to minimize the opportunities for any thing to sneak up on you. Also keep in mind that scorpions are most active at night."]

    "texts": ["OK. So Botswana is a vast, barren country that’s about 80% Kalahari Desert. If you go the 4×4 route (which I am obviously advocating hard for here), it is essential that you pack correctly. There are long stretches of HOT desert road, and outside of the main highways, they are not paved. Flat tires aren’t a guarantee but definitely a likelihood. Make sure you have AT LEAST one spare, if not two. Most flats are the result of thorns from the thorny scrub bushes that are ubiquitous in the Kalahari. Bring a tire patch-kit to mend any holes as a temporary fix.\n\nTry to mark service stations on your map before heading out so you can easily navigate to one should you need to. It’s imperative that you get your tire fixed before moving on. Do not travel without a spare. Period.", "One of the joys of driving here is that seeing other cars is rare. It can be hours before you cross paths with another vehicle. You are much more likely to have a collision with an overly energetic oryx than another car. Despite fencing alongside a good portion of the roadways, wild animals can come out of nowhere, ESPECIALLY at night, so be vigilant.\n\nDomesticated animals seem to graze along the shoulder of every stretch of the main highways in Botswana. This means cows, sheep, and donkeys are CONSTANTLY crossing back and forth, without a care in the world or any attention paid to your potentially deadly presence. This means the onus is on you to NOT hit them. On top of totaling your rental vehicle, you’ll have the daunting task of finding, and reckoning with both the Botswana police and the owner of the animal. Go slow. ", "Always travel with more water than you think you’ll need. If you break down, you may not be getting help for a whole day. Make sure you have reserves to last you. Five-Eight liters per person per day is a good amount. Same goes for food supplies and gasoline.", "Arm yourself with a decent map. GPS in Africa is a nice sentiment, but is in reality often inaccurate. Apps like google maps and maps.me may work on the main highways (although even THEN it’s a crapshoot), but once you’re off the main road FOR-GET-ABOUT-IT! What may LOOK like a road, may not be a road.\n\nGet an accurate, up-to-date PAPER map and plan your route before you start. Tracks 4 Africa has both a paper map as well as GPS software that in theory corresponds to the map, however some trouble-shooting may still be required to navigate here. "]

    "texts": ["Camping in the desert is one of the great joys of coming to Botswana, however, free camping is not the order of the day here. Camp sites in Botswana are a mix of public and privately owned affairs, but reservations ARE required for anyone hoping to pitch a tent. While the country is remote enough that you might be able to get away with a wilderness camp for a night or two, you will be taking a risk and inviting all kinds of trouble, both from a legal standpoint as well as a safety one. Staying in the official camp sites will limit any issues involving other humans.", "Make sure you have a propane gas cooker when heading into the bush. While you may end up cooking the vast majority of your food over an open flame, keep in mind that you should only build a fire on a designated fire pit at an official campsite. Otherwise, you run the risk of starting something you can’t control. Bring the gas cooker as a backup.", "Wild animals can and most likely, WILL visit during the night. Close all the car doors and windows, and make sure you put away all food and trash. Don’t bring any food into your tents, you really don’t want an elephant getting interested in your tent. Basically, don’t tempt them with a good time.", "Spiders, snakes, and scorpions are things to be wary of out here. Roll up your sleeping bags immediately after using them and knock out your shoes before putting them on. Wear a headlight when going to the bathroom and check your area for eyes before committing to the cause.", "Lastly, and very importantly, when you are picking a spot to camp, try to opt for the higher ground. Because the ground is extremely dense and water doesn’t absorb here the way it will in other, wetter places. This means flash floods can happen out of nowhere. Try to angle your car so that it’s as flat as possible. Avoid dips, slopes, and low lying areas."]
