Petty crime is a regular occurrence in tourist areas, so hold tight to your stuff and look out for the motorcycle grabs. Violent crime is rare, but drunken brawls do happen and long stretches of dark, isolated roads are probably not where you want to be, even in “seemingly safe” areas like the beaches. Female travelers should avoid walking alone on beaches, especially after dark. Road safety can be a bit of a concern here, so speak up if your driver is speeding or seems off.\n\nLand mines are no longer a real concern for most travelers staying on the beaten path, however, if you are traveling with your own vehicle or are moving around in remote areas it should be taken seriously. Stick to marked roads and do as much research as possible before you go wandering off the path. In fact, it’s probably better to not do any real wandering. Just stick to the path, and you can keep your feet."]

    "texts": ["One of the more widely reported scams involves the visa on arrival at the Thai border crossing of Poipet. There are a few different scenarios but all of the scams involve extra fees for “processing” or “expediting” your visa. The cost for the visa is $30 USD. Bring exact change and explain that it’s all the money you have. Stay polite but firm. You’ll get the visa for $30. Keep in mind you need a picture for your visa. It’s better to bring one with you, otherwise you are inviting an opportunity to get over-charged for a picture at the border.", "Always travel with a copy of your passport. If you are approached by police in the street in Cambodia and they demand to see your passport, give them the copy. The holding of a passport for ransom is something that does happen here. Only show your real passport if you are in an actual police station. Also, there is a difference between a traffic cop (blue uniform) and an army cop (army uniform, machine gun). Do what the guy with the machine gun says.", "Motorbike scams are another unpleasant one. I’ve never personally experienced this issue, but have heard of it happening. Chances are you had to hand over your passport when you rented the bike and you won’t be getting it back until you return it in good condition. So what happens when your bike goes missing? The truth is, 90% of the time, if your bike has been stolen, it was probably stolen by someone with a key… ie the rental company. That means you’ll be paying $1000 just to get your passport back. The best way to combat this is to A- put your own lock on it, or B- don’t park it on the street. Talk to your hotel or guesthouse and see what the safest option is for parking your rented motorbike. Always take pictures of any damage to the bike BEFORE driving away. It could be a good idea to provide a false address when renting the bike as well, just in case."]

Riding around in a tuk tuk can be almost unbearable if you don’t have a face mask of some kind. You may want to bring a bandana or cover your mouth with your shirt.", "This probably goes without saying, but I don’t advise wearing your nicest white button-down during your stay in Cambodia."]

Spicy curry, fried noodles, tropical fruit for days… but I honestly have met very few people who have traveled here and not experienced some form of digestive discomfort. Keep an eye out for unsanitary conditions, especially when it comes to ice. A lot of ice in Cambodia is delivered in big blocks. Even if the water itself is purified, it could be being placed on surfaces that are not. I don’t recommend having any iced beverage unless you actually see the ice coming out of a plastic-wrapped situation. This is especially true on Koh Rong, where literally 4 out of 5 people that I met experienced some serious food poisoning while on the island (myself included).", "You can’t avoid every bit of bacteria and being paranoid won’t do you any favors, but if you have a bad feeling about a restaurant or a piece of seafood, don’t eat it. It’s ok to say “no thanks”, pay your bill, and get the F out of there. Better to throw away a couple bucks than throw up violently for the next two days.", "If you do get sick and it lasts more than a day or two, go to the clinic, especially if there is blood in your stool. This most likely means you have dysentary. The doctors here will get you antibiotics right away, for very cheap. Don’t let a little thing turn into a big thing."]

The private, Thai-owned Royal Phnom Penh Hospital in the capital is probably your best bet for treating emergencies. Naga Clinic is a good alternative if you find yourself in a bind. They have offices in Phnom Penh and Siem Reap.", "If you really need to see a doctor it may be worth it to go to Bangkok as an alternative. You will absolutely have better care at any hospital in Thailand than you would in Cambodia.", "If you get dehydrated don’t use a drip. In fact, don’t let anyone near your veins, especially in smaller, local clinics. There is a risk of bacterial blood poisoning."]
