There is, of course, opportunistic theft like anywhere, and you won’t want to walk around alone at night in dark alleyways, heavily intoxicated, with large wads of cash spilling out of your pockets, but short of that scenario, you should be alright.\n\nThis is a heavily touristed island, and generally speaking, the people of Malta are welcoming and kind."]

    "texts": ["Malta is a tiny collection of islands, that, for centuries maintained a meager population that worked the land in sections and had little need or want for any sort of extensive transit network. You knew who your neighbors were and if you needed to visit them, or make it to the market in the next town, you’d work it out on an as-needed basis.\n\nFast-forward to the modern era, where vacant land is scarce and business is booming and it’s a whole other story. Malta’s economy has taken off recently, both in tourism as well as business and land development. Dramatic increases in tourism, immigration, and a steady stream of refugees are forcing big change on the once sleepy islands.\n\nRampant development is law of the land, with seemingly very little oversight. Massive building projects are underway all over the place, and in some parts of the island it’s difficult to see the buildings through the sea of cranes.", "All this to say, the population of these tiny islands is at an all time high, and traffic is getting abysmal. On top of the restrictions of space and population, throw in the traditional Maltese love of the automobile (a car for every member of the family!) and you can start to see how things might be getting a little claustrophobic.", "The roads here get jammed pretty regularly, which can lead to a lot of heightened…. tensions. If you’re going to drive here, do so defensively. Drivers tend to take a lot of risks out of frustration. Think of it this way, if you’re hating the traffic and you’re on vacation, think about how bad it is for the people trying to make it to work.", "Additionally, there seems to be a real love for speed in Malta that is inconsistent with the width of the roads and the reality of the traffic. Even pedestrians should take care when walking down the street, since, generally speaking, slowing down is not a favorite past-time of the Maltese.", "People traveling on scooters should be extra careful. Malta’s roads can be hilly and windy, with a good number of blind corners."]

    "texts": ["There is some serious, world class diving to be had in Malta. Huge, underwater, Cathedral-like caves, tons of marine life, and more shipwrecks than you can shake a fin at.", "The vast majority of the dive sites can be reached from the shore, with a simple jump off a rock and a swim. Getting back out you’ll need to climb up one of the marine ladders, which can be tricky if the swell is high.", "While there are different levels of difficulty for all the dive sites, some of them can become particularly subject to strong currents depending on the season and the weather. Make sure the dive center you are diving with has up to the minute, accurate forecasting for the dive conditions.", "Malta is one of the best places in the world to go wreck diving. There are 25 shipwrecks around the islands, all begging to be explored. Some of them are set deeper than the normal recreational diving limits however, and there it’s extremely easy to go into DECO rather quickly here. This means it’s imperative to have a working dive computer and to monitor your depth and bottom time frequently. In addition, if you’re going to penetrate any of the wrecks, make sure every member of your party has a working torch. Some rooms within the wreck are pitch black. It’s extremely easy to get disoriented once you are inside a big, hulking, dark piece of scrap metal. Organize your plan before the dive, and go over specifics about the order in which each diver will enter the wreck. You really do not want to get lost in an enclosed space 40 meters below sea level. If you are feeling uncomfortable AT ALL before or during the dive, do NOT enter the wreck.", "If you do happen to go into DECO and require a decompression chamber, fortunately there is one on the island, but bear in mind that use of the chamber is extremely expensive. It’s important that you outfit yourself with insurance that covers diving up to the depths you’re going to. If your insurance only covers to 30 meters, and you’re diving at 36 m, don’t expect to be covered if an accident occurs."]
