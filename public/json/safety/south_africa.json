This is really a shame because for the most part, tourists are completely shielded from the majority of the danger that’s quoted in the statistics. That being said, theft is the number one problem most tourists face and muggings DO happen, especially in cities like Johannesburg, even in the day time.\n\nBut don’t let this keep you away. The majority of South Africans are proud of their country, and want nothing but to be happy and go about their daily lives unmolested. But with the wealth inequality what it is, and racial tensions constantly on simmer, there will always be a few desperate people who make for a mean street. Staying alert and vigilant and leaving your valuables at your hotel is a good start to keeping yourself safe in South Africa."]

    "texts": ["Unfortunately, tensions run high in the cities of South Africa, mainly thanks to the high wealth disparity among the economic classes, as a result, the metropolitan areas definitely see their fair share of crime, from petty theft to outright violence. Displays of wealth should be avoided at all times, particularly jewelry and electronics. This includes cameras and phones. You should take only what you need from your hotel and keep it in your pockets if possible.", "Cape Town proper is more or less safe during the day. You should feel comfortable walking around on your own, but do take note of your surroundings. The trains become unsafe once the sun goes down, and it’s better take cabs if you are going any distance. Try to walk in well-lit areas after dark.", "Johannesburg is notoriously rough. While some areas of the city are well secured, like shopping malls and parts of the business district, crime can happen here at any time day or night. It’s better to avoid the neighborhoods of Hillbrow, Yeoville, Berea, and Alexandra entirely. Don’t walk around without knowing where you are going. It’s better not to wander, so map out where you are going and ask what the best way to get there is from your hotel staff. If you do take public transit here, only do so during the day. If you happen to be mugged, avoid eye contact with the assailant, and surrender whatever possessions they ask for immediately. Crimes of opportunity can turn violent very quickly here. This is not the place to play hero.", "Same goes in Durban, though it is a bit smaller than Johannesburg so there is seemingly less opportunity for crime."]

Cape Town’s trains go from shabby-cute to shabby-scary real quick with the setting sun.", "In Johannesburg the mini-bus taxis are ubiquitous and are the primary form of transit for about 70% of the cities population. The passengers are mostly black Africans and so the taxis are often referred to as “Black Taxis”, but let’s just call them mini-buses, since that’s what they are. These “taxis” can be a wonderful, cheap way to get around the city and are generally safe during the day, however I don’t recommend them at night. It is also imperative that you know exactly which route you are taking and where to get off at your destination. It isn’t so much the ride that is unsafe, but the possibility of ending up somewhere you shouldn’t be, and inadvertently placing yourself in danger. If you want to brave the transit system, go for it, but check with someone who knows the routes (like your hotel staff) before waving one down.", "Uber is now available in the cities in South Africa. This is by far going to be the easiest and quickest way to navigate the cities without a car. However, many of the local taxi companies DO NOT LIKE Uber, nor Uber drivers, nor Uber passengers. There have been instances in which Uber drivers have been followed or blocked from picking up a fare. You may want to use official licensed taxi’s when available, but download the Uber app and at the very least have it as a back up should you need it."]

This is not something to be taken lightly. Don’t stick your head in that hippo’s mouth for your instagram picture. In fact, don’t even go near that hippo. Hippo’s see nothing wrong with biting your head off. Don’t approach any of the animals. Even the ones that don’t have an interest in eating you will certainly be happy enough to step on you. Elephants can be territorial. If they look like they want you to back it up…. BACK IT UP.", "On safari, don’t get out of your car. In fact, there have been some reports of lions behaving rather… strangely… in the park lately: biting tires, swatting at windows… Always listen to your guide. If he/she recommends leaving your window rolled up, leave it rolled up. If they tell you “don’t get out to pee here, wait”, then WAIT.", "Snakes are another thing to watch out for here. Anti-venom is species specific, so if you do get bit… do your best to remember what it looked like and get help immediately. Ever see “I Dreamed of Africa?”… that was Kenya, but still. You get it.\n\nDitto for spiders, scorpions, and other small deadly situations. Wear shoes/boots when going to an outdoor latrine. Check the toilet before you sit down, and always shake out your shoes before putting them on."]

It’s a little more extensive in Cape Town, and theres a few blocks in the downtown area that form a sort of “gay village”. If you’re into boutique hotels, brunch, and designer sunglasses, this could be for you.", "Section 9 of the South African constitution specifically forbids discrimination on the basis of sex, gender, or sexual orientation. This actually makes South Africa one of the only countries in the world with protections for LGBT citizens embedded in the very framework of their system of government.", "HOWEVER. The words are wonderful, but make no mistake here, South Africa is still a difficult place for MANY queer Africans who are struggling for acceptance among a skeptical population. Anti-gay violence is not uncommon here."]

They aren’t expensive, so use them instead of walking when you can."]
