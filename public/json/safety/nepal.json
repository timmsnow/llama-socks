It’s a very friendly country, and generally speaking the only real safety concerns will come from nature herself, or the infrastructure she affects."]

    "texts": ["So, obviously hiking in the Himilayas isn’t something to be taken lightly. We are talking about the highest mountain chain in the world here and there have been many people who have died making attempts at summits. Not every mountain is an Everest though, and there are plenty of hikes that can be enjoyed without major pre-planing and forethought, however, remember that once you are up there, you are not within easy reach. Should something go wrong, depending on where you are, you might be on your own, so plan accordingly.", "Everest is the big one here. The temperature at the summit never gets above 0° C, and timing can be a crucial contributor to having a successful hike. Planning your hike for the less volatile months of April/May or September-November will give you more stable weather. Make sure you get the proper gear. That means good, wind-resistant camping equiptment and clothing, as well as waterproof everything. Staying dry is paramount. Your guides should be able to assist you with other required emergency equiptment, but don’t rely on someone else to make sure you have what you need. Do your research and don’t take this lightly. Chances are if anyone is going to get frostbite, it’s probably not going to be your experienced, well-trodden guide.", "Hiking the “lesser” mountains like the lower Annapurnas can be a joyous experience, but the same rules apply here, especially in terms of water-proofing, because the weather is unpredictable up here. Blue skies can give way to rain, snow, hail, or mist within seconds. If you are doing one of the lower loops chances are there will be a tea house within a few kilometers that you can stop in should you need to, but once you get higher into the mountains those will become more infrequent. If you are going on the less trodden mountain paths, don’t hike alone. Seriously. Ever seen that movie 127 hours? NOPE.", "In summertime the weather is balmy and the monsoons come. This means literal rushing rivers of snowmelt that come down off the mountain. OH, and the god damn LEECHES.\n\nI reccommend April, when the rhododendrons are in bloom, as nice alternative."]

The roads were never wonderful, and since the 2015 earthquake some of them have become impassable. While they are working on getting things moving again, the sheer numbers of cars and buses on the roads makes getting anywhere a living nightmare. Hiring a private transfer/taxi for short distances can cut down on your time somewhat as they have more freedom to bob and weave through traffic. All of it is more than a little unnerving so buckle up when you can.", "The highway to Pokhara is no exception. On a good day the drive will take 7 hours, and on a bad day double that. It is not uncommon to see giant lorries (or less giant passenger vans and buses) overturned after careening off the road and rolling down into the valley below. The high amounts of traffic (in both directions) means people take hazardous risks when overtaking. If you’re in a speeding vehicle, tell the driver to slow down, not to overtake blindly, and to watch the road.", "Equally terrifying is the mist that can sometimes blanket entire mountain roads. Driving up the mountain to towns like Bandipur often involve driving through thick mist which can be so blinding it’s difficult to see more than 5 feet ahead, on a road with razor sharp turns. Everyone, drive slowly please."]

LGBT rights are protected by the Nepalese constitution, and transgender rights are even highlighted:\n\n- The right to have their preferred gender display on their identity cards\n\n- A prohibition on discrimination on any ground including sex or sexual orientation by the State, or anyone else.\n\n- Substitution of gender-neutral terms for the previous “male”, “female”, “son”, and “daughter”\n\n- The right of access to state process and public services for gender and sexual minorities", "This is wonderful news for the LGBT people living in Nepal. Unfortunately there are still societal pressures to conform to the hetero-normative lifestyle, and LGBT Nepalese still face discrimination in their communities on a regular basis. Tourists won’t have any issues in this regard, although, like everywhere, better to not engage in public displays."]

Most of the malaria present in Nepal is Vivax, so keep that in mind if you are planning on taking medication. Otherwise use plenty of bug cream and always sleep with a mosquito net.", "Food safety is something to look out for here. Avoid ice, unless it is uniformly shaped (made out of purified water and packaged to be sold for consumption). For regular old “travelers diarrhea” you can keep OTC meds or activated charcoal handy. The last thing you want is a war of attrition with your lower intestines as you trundle upon the myriad potholes that line your 8 hour bus journey across the Nepalese countryside.", "If things don’t get better within a day or so, go to a doctor. There are enough parasites and other nasty bacteria to warrant being doubly sure you are ok. The Nepalese doctors are familiar with all of them, and can help you recover quickly. Better to see someone regionally than a doctor back home since, more than likely, they will be unfamiliar with the particulars of the bug that ails you. The CIWEC Clinic in Pokhara is a great place to go if you aren’t feeling right. They specialize in helping foreigners."]

Nearly 9,000 people were killed and over 22,000 were injured. Buildings fell all across Nepal, and a lot of the infrastructure remains damaged to this day. The structural integrity of buildings in major cities is questionable, and many are propped up, precariously, by temporary support beams, holding entire brick walls in place that would otherwise be crumbling to the ground. If something looks unsafe, it almost assuredly is. It is best to keep a wide berth. Many Nepalese people live in houses that are structurally unsound because they have no choice. More earthquakes will undoubtably occur in the coming years and it will take a lot more than support beams to keep those buildings upright."]
