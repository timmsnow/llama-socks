It’s an extremely friendly country, and for the most part, if you’re smiling, people will be happy to interact with you. With that in mind, here are a few things to take note of."]

    "texts": ["Even locals will tell you that Nairobi in particular is regarded as being exceedingly dangerous. Stories abound about travelers minding their own business, walking down the street and being mugged in broad daylight. I am not going to say that doesn’t happen, but to me, this appeared to be a yes and no situation. Of course anything can happen anywhere, but if you are in the more tourist-heavy areas of Karen, Langata, or the Westland’s you shouldn’t have a problem moving around during the day.", "The area around the bus station downtown is sort of perma-sketchy. Theft can be a regular occurrence so just keep a tight watch on your bags if you’re going by bus. The rest of downtown gets real sketchy real quick once the sun goes down and the businesses close. It’s not advisable to be walking around the downtown area after 5 or 6 pm. Obviously don’t invite trouble. Keep your valuables tucked away, and maybe hold off on taking copious photos of the center city. People live there, it’s not an open-air museum.", "Uber also operates in the city and securing rides is extremely cheap, so if you aren’t feeling comfortable, take a cab. Always take a car at night, even for short distances. Tourists stick out like a sore thumb here, and in a city with extremely high income inequality, it simply isn’t worth the risk."]

    "texts": ["These are wild animals, people... BIG, untethered, often hungry, wild animals. Africa is no joke, and safaris have rules. The first and most important rule is DON’T GET OUT OF THE CAR. There are occasional exceptions, like when you have to pee, or when your boyfriend accidentally drops your camera out the window, etc…. but unless your guide specifically tells you it’s ok, DON’T DO IT. Pretty much every animal out there can kill you and I am about 95% sure they wouldn’t even feel bad about it. Especially the hippos, they really never feel bad about it.", "Now, some of the animals are more sensitive than others. Sometimes those sensitive animals happen to be the big animals. Don’t tease or call to the wild animals, because they just might come running. and I’m telling you, a charging elephant don’t care one spit about your silly little SUV. If an elephant starts to charge, back up immediately and give them space. Their first charge is generally a warning, but better to not stick around for the second one.", "Give all the animals the right of way and they will most likely let you live. Give them the respect they deserve and they might let you get close enough to get a good picture of them eating one of their friends for lunch. Awwwww."]

Homophobic laws originally put in place by the British Empire have evolved into a disgusting display of unbridled bigotry that reaches all corners of the continent. It hasn’t helped that armies of badly dressed christian crusaders (mostly American Evangelicals)  have taken up the Anti-gay cause with a bewildering vehemence, bewildering especially on a planet in which legitimate tragedies that require actual action occur on a daily basis and could benefit from the resources and passion that they insist on wasting on meaningless causes such as telling people who they can and can not get down with.", "Many of these Evangelical groups have raised massive sums of money which comes to Africa as aid money, but conditionally. Churches are being built, and wells are being dug, but rarely without a healthy dose of proselytizing  HELLFIRE. Anti-gay rhetoric is being taught in schools and has become so deeply embedded in the national psyche of many African nations, that even though there are stirrings of reform in the air, it could take decades to undo the damage. Gay people are often targeted by the government, as well as by vigilantes.", "Tourists are not generally affected, but I wouldn’t recommend discussing the subject of homosexuality. I traveled with my same-sex partner and we never encountered anything worse than the occasional raised eyebrow. I felt generally safe, but I remained alert pretty much always.", "It’s heartbreaking that this is the state of affairs in a country with so much love to give. Don’t let this keep you from traveling to Kenya. Your presence will only help add to the visibility of a people greatly in need of seeing some friendly faces."]

And then 2019 happened. I happened to be in Nairobi at the time of the DusitD2 complex attack, in which 21 people were killed in a hotel by the terrorist organization Al-Shabaab. It was a scary day in the city.\n\nThat being said, despite the tragic losses, authorities swooped in quickly and efficiently and got a handle on the situation relatively quickly compared to previous incidents in the past. There is a strong desire to make Kenya a safe country for everyone, and it’s starting to really make a difference.", "There are still some parts of the country that are better avoided, like the road between Malindi and Lamu on the north coast, where there are still occasional occurrences of bus-jackings and people are encouraged to travel in convoys. For these stretches of the country it is advisable to fly. It probably wouldn’t have been your favorite bus ride anyway."]
