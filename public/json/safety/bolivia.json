Whenever there are vast gaps between the rich and poor you can count on a spike in opportunistic crime.\n\nHowever, if you’re concerned about Bolivia safety, don’t be. Using the same common sense you use when traveling anywhere, you should be able to steer clear of 99.9% of any trouble that might come your way."]

    "texts": ["Bolivia’s relationship with the coca plant, and subsequently it’s more famous powder derivative cocaine, is a complicated one. Coca cultivation has for centuries… neh, MILLENIA been a mainstay among the indigenous peoples of Bolivia. The coca leaf has numerous medicinal uses, and is particularly helpful to those suffering the ill effects of altitude sickness. Coca leaf tea can be bought just about anywhere, and should you be feeling under duress you may want to consider giving it a try. It worked wonders on my altitude headache in Ecuador.", "Bolivian President Evo Morales made the cultivation of the coca plant officially legal (although highly regulated) in Bolivia, and although cocaine itself remains illegal to produce and possess, naturally the legalization of the coca plant has led to an increase in cocaine production. Bolivia now counts itself among the top three cocaine producing countries in the world… giving rise to a very… excitable.. drug market.", "Which brings me to Route 36. You may have heard about a so-called “cocaine bar” in La Paz, where police and politicians alike turn a blind eye, patrons can purchase coke openly from the waitresses, and merriment and wonder ensue…\n\nStories about this bar have been circulating in the backpacker scene worldwide for over a decade now, inspiring many would-be cokies to go hunting for this one of a kind watering-hole.\n\nAnd the stories are true. The bar really exists. At least for now anyway.\n\nThe bar itself is an illegal one, and anyone hoping to find their way there should take note that it’s completely at their own risk. Literally every part of this experience is sketchy, from the cab ride to the questionable bag of cocaine you’ll receive, cut with god-knows-what… and it’s not something that I would ever endorse, certainly not here on this online travel guide. But whether or not you choose to partake in the experience, you should know that there are some definite risks involved that shouldn’t be ignored.\n\nPolitical winds in Bolivia shift regularly, and what may be tolerated today could be severely punished tomorrow. I doubt Bolivian prison is somewhere you were hoping to take a personal tour. Also, those behind the bar, gracious hosts that they are, are more than likely involved with people you may hope to never meet during your lifetime. While it seems to be a stable operation for now, you never know when things could turn ugly. Just know it’s always a possibility."]

    "texts": ["Opportunistic crime is something to be watched out for while traveling in Bolivia. Although violent crime is not so common, solo travelers concerned about Bolivia’s safety, should definitely take care in the big cities at night.", "Take only radio-taxis if you are traveling at night, and solo females should probably stick to the radio-taxis at all times of the day just to be safe. While the majority of the taxi drivers in Bolivia are friendly, hard-working people… it only takes one bad seed as they say.", "Using the same guiding safety principles that you use anywhere in the world will go a long way to keeping you safe in Bolivia. Try not to indulge in displays of wealth, keep jewelry and flashy electronics to a minimum. Carrying wads of cash around on you is probably a bad idea, take just what you need for the day and put the rest in the hotel safe, or divide it into different areas of your person, so that, should you be pick-pocketed, your losses are reduced.", "Public transit is generally safe, but know where you are going. There are bad neighborhoods in every city and you’ll want to be aware of the places to avoid. Map out where you plan to go in the city before you leave your hotel, so you’re familiar with the major streets and public transit stops. If you do get lost, and things look like they might get dicey, try to call for a radio-taxi from a restaurant or a hotel and have them scoop you up."]

    "texts": ["Like Peru, a good deal of Bolivia’s most exhilarating and inspirational sites are found at high elevation. If you aren’t accustomed to it, elevation sickness can come on quick and really impair your basic functionality. It can affect people in different ways, but some of the basic things to watch out for are:\n\nAn inability to sleep\nDizziness\nHeadache\nFatigue\nLoss of Appetite\nVomiting", "The best way to avoid getting altitude sickness is to ascend slowly. Making your way from the lowlands up to the mountains slowly will help stave off the worst of the symptoms. It’s NOT a good idea to go straight from Santa Cruz to Uyuni for example. During the Uyuni tour, you are likely to be going to altitudes of over 5,000 meters above sea level. This can result in some seriously debilitating altitude sickness if you do not ascend slowly.", "Give yourself a few days to adjust to the heights before embarking on a big trek. If you think you might have fallen victim to altitude sickness, take it easy. Don’t drink alcohol, try to rest, and consider moving a few hundred meters lower if you can. Once you start feeling better you can continue on your way to the top.\n\nChewing coca leaves will definitely ease your symptoms, same with drinking coca tea, but it is not a cure and the relief is temporary. Rest and a reduction in altitude are what the doctor ordered.", "It might feel brisk at these high altitudes, but let's be clear... At upwards of 4,000 meters, you are very close to the sun. Wear plenty of sun protection and bring a hat. Sunglasses are a must in Uyuni."]

You can of course, try your hand at haggling, or you can shop somewhere else, but all in all we’re probably talking pennies here right? So try to not let it bother you so much.", "Bolivia is a very politically engaged country, with politically motivated protests occurring regularly and taking many forms.", "It’s not that these protests are particularly threatening for foreign travelers, but any time you have large crowds of impassioned people marching through a city, it’s generally a good idea to steer clear. Protests in Bolivia, as in most countries around the world, can shift to violence quickly, regardless of the original intention.", "The military is often called into play to regulate and road blocks and road closures are almost always associated with periods of protest. Know that this can affect your travel plans and plan accordingly. It can be a good idea to communicate with your hotel staff about where you’re planning on heading next since more than likely, they will have heard of any potential problem areas before you will.", "Most of the political action takes place in the big cities, although occasionally it can affect smaller regional towns as well. Be vigilant and check the news regularly while you’re there."]
