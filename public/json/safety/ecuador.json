Opportunistic crime on buses and busy locations tends to be what’s most often reported.\n\nNatural disasters, like earthquakes, while not super common, do occur in Ecuador and sometimes with a devastating impact. The biggest danger facing those traveling to Ecuador is probably road safety. All of this being said, the vast majority of the Ecuadorian people are friendly and open with foreigners, and most people will pass their time in Ecuador without issue."]

    "texts": ["For the most part crime in Ecuador is not violent in nature. Pick-pockets and other petty criminals are absolutely active, especially in the big cities in parks and on public transit, but for the most part violence is not a part of the equation. If you keep tabs on your valuables while on the bus, even turning your purse or backpack around so that you have a full view of it at all times, you should be able to avoid someone slicing open your bag and stealing your valuables.", "There have been reports of “express-kidnappings”. This is the scenario where you find yourself compelled to take out all your money from the ATM and give it to a complete stranger, who is most likely NOT going to pay you back. These express-kidnappings are again, typically crimes of opportunity, and can mostly be avoided by knowing which areas to avoid, and taking extra care when moving around at night.", "La Carolina and El Ejido parks in Quito are best avoided all together, and the streets around the Centro Historico take on an ominous air after dark. In Guayaquil you’re better off staying out of the Kennedy, Alborada, and Urdessa districts. Take extra care even in the main tourist areas like the Malecon after dark.", "Occasionally these express-kidnappings/muggings can coincide with or are the result of being drugged. Avoid taking any drinks, food, or cigarettes from strangers. Even paper leaflets are said to be capable of transmitting a sedative through the skin. This scenario is unlikely, but always go with your gut, and don’t except candy from strangers.\n\nTraveling during the day is a good way to avoid the risks that come, inherently with night-time travel. Highway robberies have been known to occur, whether in your own vehicle or on a public bus. As a general rule it’s better to avoid travel at night."]

    "texts": ["While MOST of the traffic accidents reported in Ecuador occur in the cities and are largely due to speeding violations, or drunk-driving, intercity fatalities along highways do occur with more regularity than would be liked. There are a number of things to be cognizant of, and to take into consideration when preparing for a trip in Ecuador.", "If you are planning on driving yourself, make sure you only drive during the day. Roads are poorly marked and visibility is tough at night. Especially in rural areas. The conditions of the road can go from brand new to disheveled in the blink of an eye. Many of the highways have no guard rails and visibility can be extremely limited. It’s imperative that you travel with spare tires, parts, and fuel if you’re going to attempt to go it alone. Make sure you are insured to the teeth in case of an accident.", "Fog is common on coastal and mountain highways, and the resulting poor visibility frequently causes accidents. Land-slides and heavy rains make driving in the wet season particularly hazardous. In some instances the rain and flooding can get so bad that highways close, and cars get washed away. On some of the more remote mountain passes, rock-slides can block roadways for hours causing traffic to back-up with little room to maneuver around or even back-track. If you’re unfortunate enough to get stuck in this scenario, brace yourself for a long wait.", "Long distance buses have their fair share of dangers especially at night, from sleepy (or drunk) bus drivers to close encounters with wayward herd animals, since livestock are often herded along the more rural highways. Bus-jackings and robberies have been known to occur, although this is uncommon and unlikely on the more reputable long-distance bus companies, still it is better to keep a close eye on your possessions when in transit anywhere in the country."]

If you aren’t accustomed to it, elevation sickness can come on quick and really impair your basic functionality. It can affect people in different ways, but some of the basic things to watch out for are:\n\nAn inability to sleep\nDizziness\nHeadache\nFatigue\nLoss of Appetite\nVomiting", "The best way to avoid getting altitude sickness is to ascend slowly. Making your way from the coast up to the mountains slowly will help stave off the worst of the symptoms. Give yourself a few days to adjust to the heights before embarking on a big trek. If you think you might have fallen victim to altitude sickness, take it easy. Don’t drink alcohol, try to rest, and consider moving a few hundred meters lower if you can. Once you start feeling better you can continue on your way to the top.", "In Ecuador, there are numerous free-hikes you can embark on, or hikes where hiring a guide isn’t required. If you choose to go it alone, without a guide please keep a few things in mind. DON’T hike by yourself. At least bring a friend along. You may go long stretches without seeing another soul and help can be hard to come by. Make sure someone knows where you are headed, and do some research. While some hikes may SEEM straight-forward, much of Ecuador’s numerous hiking trails are poorly marked, or not marked at all and GPS can not be relied upon to provide accurate mapping of the mountains. If it’s not a well-trodden path, and you aren’t sure you know exactly where you’re going, hire a guide. It could make all the difference."]

Even conversion therapy has been officially banned from being practiced within the country.", "That being said, culturally Ecuador remains a very conservative country. Religion still plays a large role in society and machismo is rampant. Ecuadorian society in general still views homosexuality negatively, and many gay people feel unsafe coming out of the closet.", "While there is momentum in the push towards gay acceptance, it’s still not a great idea to openly display homosexual affection. It is fair to say you are unlikely to be targeted merely for “seeming gay”, and most hotels and guesthouses will not take issue with you sharing a bed with your same-sex partner, however, it’s always a good idea to be aware of your surroundings and to avoid potentially dangerous situations by pushing the issue."]

Guts in the “I refuse to let the destructive oppression of the patriarchy keep me from living my best life!” kind of way. Way more impressive.\n\nSolo females should be able to navigate Ecuador without trouble, however...", "1- Female travelers should not drive in Ecuador alone. There is far too much opportunity for something to go wrong. This is especially true at night, but in general, solo driving should be avoided.\n\n2- Walking in unlit, rural areas alone, or along beaches should be avoided as well.\n\n3- Better to not take taxis alone if possible, and always try to use the official radio taxis, especially at night.\n\n4- When walking at night, walk facing oncoming traffic so it’s harder for cars to follow you/surprise you.\n\n5- Don’t accept any food, drink, smoke, or drugs from anyone. Druggings are more common than they should be.\n\nI have no doubt that most women reading this will file these tips under the “no shit” category, but I wanted to list them anyway. Stay Safe!"]
