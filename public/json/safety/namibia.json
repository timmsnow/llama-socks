    "texts": ["As far as African cities go, Windhoek is placid little town and about as safe and quiet as they come. People are mostly very friendly to tourists and during the day you shouldn’t have any problems walking around town. Petty crimes like theft are on the rise in all cities in Namibia however so staying vigilant is a good idea. Don’t wear any nice jewelry or carry expensive items, it’s just asking for a problem.", "If there is a safe provided at your hotel, just use it. Avoid leaving your safari 4×4 parked on the side of the road with your anything inside. Outside of a private parking lot they will be a draw for opportunists.\n\nAlthough it’s rare, you will want to keep your doors locked at any service station to avoid any bag snatching. It’s a good idea not to walk alone at night, and even in groups it’s wise to stay in well lit areas, or just take a taxi. Muggings are rare, but they do happen.\n\nKeeping yourself aware of your surroundings should be sufficient here. Windhoek is, for the most part an easy and safe city to navigate."]

    "texts": ["The same old general rules apply here as in the rest of Africa when you’re talking about animal safety, however keep in mind that in Namibia there are large open areas without fencing, and animals often appear in droves even outside of the National Parks.", "Don’t stick your head in that hippo’s mouth for your instagram picture. In fact, don’t even go near that hippo. Hippo’s see nothing wrong with biting your head off. Don’t approach any of the animals. Even the ones that don’t have an interest in eating you will certainly be happy enough to step on you. Elephants can be territorial. If they look like they want  you to back it up…. BACK IT UP.", "In addition to watching out for yourself, make sure to you tread lightly in their space. Some animals, especially the grazing variety can spook easy. If they feel anxious because you are getting to close, they can freak out and actually injure themselves in the process. I’ve seen a gazelle lance itself on a fence post trying to flee from an over-zealous cameraman. Let’s try to treat these guys with some respect right?", "Don’t get out of your safari vehicle. If you do need to pee, do it quickly, and make sure you’re watching the ground for snakes etc. Namibia is vast, and the chances of you making it to a hospital in time to receive any anti-venom is extremely low."]

    "texts": ["OK. So Namibia is HUGE right? Huge and empty. If you go the 4×4 route (which I am obviously advocating hard for here), it is essential that you pack correctly. There are long stretches of HOT desert road that are not paved. Flat tires aren’t a guarantee but definitely a likelihood. Make sure you have AT LEAST one spare, if not two. Try to mark service stations on your map before heading out so you can easily navigate to one should you need to. Travel with a tire repair kit, and get your tire fixed at a service station before moving on. Do not travel without a spare. Period.", "One of the joys of driving here is that seeing other cars is rare. It can be hours before you cross paths with another vehicle. You are much more likely to have a collision with an overly energetic oryx than another car. Despite fencing alongside a good portion of the roadways, the animals can come out of nowhere, so be vigilant.", "Always travel with more water than you think you’ll need. If you break down, you may not be getting help for a whole day. Make sure you have reserves to last you. Five to eight liters per person per day is a good amount. Same goes for food supplies and gasoline. Extra Jerry cans of petrol are never a bad idea. Extra snacks…. I mean, always right?", "Arm yourself with a decent map. GPS in Africa is a nice sentiment, but is in reality often inaccurate. Apps like google maps and maps.me may work on the main highways (although even THEN it’s a crapshoot), but once you’re off the main road FOR-GET-ABOUT-IT! What may LOOK like a road, may not be a road.\n\nGet an accurate, up-to-date PAPER map and plan your route before you start. Tracks 4 Africa has both a paper map as well as GPS software that in theory corresponds to the map, however some trouble-shooting may still be required to navigate here."]

    "texts": ["Camping in the desert is one of the great joys of coming to Namibia. While you can bush camp in some remote corners of Namibia outside of National Parks and private property, note that staying outside of the official campgrounds does come with risks. As Namibia has become more and more popular of a destination, crime along the back-roads has increased. Muggings can occur. In addition, you may find yourself accidentally camping on private property, which is a bad idea for obvious reasons.  Staying in the official camp sites will limit any issues involving other humans.", "Make sure you have a propane gas cooker when heading into the bush. While you may end up cooking the vast majority of your food over an open flame, keep in mind that you should only build a fire on a designated fire pit at an official campsite. Otherwise, you run the risk of starting something you can’t control. Bring the gas cooker as a backup.", "Wild animals can and most likely, WILL visit during the night. Close all the car doors and windows, and make sure you put away all food and trash. Don’t bring any food into your tents, you really don’t want an elephant getting interested in your tent. Basically, don’t tempt them with a good time.", "Spiders, snakes, and scorpions are things to be wary of out here. Roll up your sleeping bags immediately after using them and knock out your shoes before putting them on. Wear a headlight when going to the bathroom and check your area before committing to the cause.", "Lastly, and very importantly, when you are picking a spot to camp, try to opt for the higher ground. Because the ground is extremely dense and water doesn’t absorb here the way it will in other, wetter places. This means flash floods can happen out of nowhere. Dried up river beds, which can look like a smooth and comfortable nook for your tent/vehicle can turn into raging rivers in minutes with the right amount of rainfall. Avoid dips and low lying areas."]
