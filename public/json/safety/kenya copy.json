There can be issue with haze/smoke pollution from the slash and burn farming that happens on the regular in Sumatra and Borneo and blows over to the main land.\n\nIn and around the islands of Sabah pirates can be an issue. The incidents are infrequent, but it is best to follow the local news when traveling in the area."]

A good deal of Malaysian Borneo has been cordoned off, cut down, sold to developers, and turned into Palm plantations, but even with mankind’s best made efforts, you can’t take the wild out of Borneo. While many animals are under threat, there are still places where you will encounter not only semi-wild orangutans, but also fully wild ones, with limited human exposure. Given the destruction of their environment and the harassment they have faced from humans, it’s fair to say that they are probably at least a little bit territorial over the sliver of jungle they have left. Don’t tease them or call to them. They can, and probably will, smash your face in. Better to be a silent observer.", "Sarawak’s crocodile population is booming, and people be getting’ eaten. Maybe give the guys a wide berth. You can look but you can’t touch aight?"]

Permits must be obtained, accommodation has to be sorted sometimes weeks in advance, and all of it can end up adding up to be more than a little expensive.", "Everyone diving in Sipidan must be accounted for and registered with the Government. While this is an annoyance, it’s for your own protection. For years pirates from the semi-lawless southern portion of the Philippine island of Palawan have been coming to Saba and scooping divers out of the ocean to hold for ransom.\n\nWhile the security has tightened in recent years (you’ll see loads of Malaysian military with big, fuck-off guns hanging around Semporna), these are real pirates, and they aren’t coming here for the world class diving (it really is quite stunning down there). Rules have been put in place that have helped to curb the kidnappings and they are actually extremely rare these days.", "Currents in Sipidan are known to be strong and you must be an advanced diver to partake. Just follow the rules, and listen to your dive master."]

Malaysian sanitation tends to be more regulated than some of the surrounding countries, but just bear it in mind when you are gorging on that Laksa. Keep some meds on hand (activated charcoal is the best!)", "Dehydration is probably your biggest enemy. You will, undoubtedly be sweating bullets for the majority of your time here. Drink that Pocari Sweat! It’s a “ion supply” drink that has a similar composition to the fluids within your body. Originally made by a Japanese company, it is everywhere in Malaysia. Good for what ails you. Or stick with the classics and drink a coconut."]

Tourists are treated differently than locals and your everyday Malaysian tends to be friendly and accommodating to foreigners. You may encounter some raised eyebrows, or even moderate rudeness if you are sharing a room/bed with a member of the same sex, but you are unlikely to be denied a room or put in any real danger.", "Don’t show affection in public. Straight or gay this is frowned upon and will probably provoke a reaction.", "There are a few gay bars in Kuala Lumpur. They tend to be hard to find and are often in the basement of a mall complex with a chained lock or some other deterrent on the front door. This is mostly to discourage harassment from the police, which does happen from time to time. If you want to check out the gay scene, I encourage you to do so. All of the bar owners and patrons I encountered were extremely welcoming and happy to talk about what gay life in Malaysia is all about."]
