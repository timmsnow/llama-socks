Your biggest worry should be burning the roof of your mouth on that delicious okinomiyaki you just so eagerly shoveled into your pie-hole. Natural disasters like earthquakes and tsunamis are definitely a thing here and not to be taken lightly, however all buildings in Japan are required to have an earthquake-resistant structure and are designed to move with the earth. It’s not full-proof, but it goes a long way. Gotta love the Japanese.\n\nAssuming you’ll be keeping a wide berth from the radioactive hotspot of Fukushima, I’m going to focus less on safety here and more on… how to act in Japan. You know, MANNERS and such. Japan is a country built heavily on tradition. Remember you are a guest in this beautifully meticulous country, and you better respect it!"]

If you are a rude, loud, obnoxious, disorderly, or messy individual… prepare to be heavily disliked!", "While Japanese people, for the most part, are extremely gracious hosts, if they find themselves in a situation where they have to choose between you and their moral obligation to honor good manners, then you better believe you’re gonna get the boot. Even in restaurants, where most westerners are accustomed to getting everything and anything they want, if the restaurant decides you are being too loud, or disruptive, they will ask you to leave. Some hotels will not take bookings from foreigners out of fear that they will be obnoxious, or irritating to their Japanese guests, and, to be fair, they’re probably not wrong.", "Within the first 24 hours of your trip to Japan you will undoubtedly come to realize that you better take those shoes off before you walk in that door! Any home or hotel or temple you enter in Japan will have a set of adorable house slippers primed and waiting for you to slip right into should you need to go further than the doorway. Take this rule very seriously. Should you need the loo, you will find ANOTHER set of slippers ready and waiting for you at the bathroom door. These are “bathroom only” slippers, obviously. If you really want to earn some points, it’s a good look to shuffle out of the bathroom backwards and leave the slippers pointing in the right direction for the next guest to use.", "Follow the rules of the almighty queue. Whether you are waiting for the subway or a bowl of ramen, there is a god-damn queue and THAT guy was here first. Don’t you dare be a line jumper, or you’ll be “hyper-power-activated” right on out of there. This isn’t New York. We’re civilized here.", "Onsens are the communal Japanese hot springs and they are heavenly. If I could i would onsen all day everyday. I’d put my little wet towel on my head, crack an ice cold Sapporo, and just onsen the night away. BUT, I’m covered in tattoos. This means about 50% of the onsens in Japan aren’t having it. It’s an out-dated rule, and times are changing, meaning more and more onsens are allowing guests with tattoos to partake, but you better check first. I found that when I asked, graciously, and in Japanese of course, most of the onsens would tell me to “just be discreet” and wave me through. Some of them would deny me access, but if you ask first, you are avoiding any bad blood with other bathers. If someone gets upset, you’ve already covered it with the guys at the top.", "It’s all about being humble. Don’t be an asshole. The Japanese really respond well to people who aren’t assholes."]

The majority of the population of Japan accept homosexuality as a part of society and believe they deserve protection under the law. That being said, gay marriage is not legal, and same-sex households aren’t afforded the same legal protections as mixed-gender households.", "Onsens are not gay bath-houses. So don’t be rude. No staring.", "Open displays of affection are frowned upon in general, gay or straight. So just be polite."]

Following a particularly bad quake off the coast of the Miyagi Prefecture in 1978, the Building Standard Act was revised and required buildings to resist an earthquake of JMA seismic scale upper 6 or higher.\n\nEvery major quake brings a re-evaluation of the building code standards and after 1995 the Act for Promotion of Renovation for Earthquake-Resistant Structures came into affect making earth-quake proofing older buildings a priority. This means that over the last few decades Japan has been re-enforcing ALL of its structures to be able to withstand major tectonic movements. Of course you can’t account for everything, but a lot of lives and property have been saved because of this.", "The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster that occurred on March 11, 2011 was a super huge bummer that basically poisoned an entire district of Japan, not to mention an huge swaths of the Pacific ocean. The Fukushima nuclear power plant suffered a devastating meltdown after an earthquake (and subsequent tsunami), disabled the emergency generators, cutting off power and initiating a series of meltdowns and a release of radioactive material. The disaster is the worst nuclear situation since Chernobyl, and the only other disaster to be given the Level 7 event classification of the International Nuclear Event Scale. Clean up is ongoing, and it isn’t looking good. This will be a problem for decades to come. Don’t go here."]
