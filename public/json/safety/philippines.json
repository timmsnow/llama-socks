    "texts": ["The Philippines is a country with HUGE wealth disparity. Tent cities abound in the slums of Manila and shoeless children stepping through the streets lined with broken glass and general waste is an all too common sight. Bridges and overpasses are converted into makeshift homes with cardboard and plastic. Access to clean water is a luxury not afforded to a significant portion of the country’s population. On the flip side, areas of Manila like Makati City are home to millionaires and boast the highest concentration of local and multi-national corporations in the entire country, creating a wealth vacuum that rarely extends to the slums outside.\n\nWhen there is crime in the Philippines it is almost always a result of this wealth disparity. Desperate people must act desperately in order to survive. Drugs can play a role as well. As a foreigner of privilege it’s imperative to understand and be sensitive to the dynamics at play here. Treating those around you with respect will go a long way to being treated in kind, and while theft is something that may happen to you while you are in the Philippines, try to remember that it is not the people, but the situation forced upon them that creates these societal fractures."]

The problem is that for years corporate power and poverty have weighed heavily on which restaurants succeed and which do not. This means there is a TON of fast food in the Philippines. So much so that it’s treated like a normal meal. Don’t forget that the good old US of A planted its fat foot on their soil for about 50 odd years and they didn’t leave without throwing a few calories out the window on their way out.", "Almost everything in the Philippines that you will find in a restaurant is fatty. Or fried. Or sweetened beyond recognition. I have actually been served spaghetti bolognese with SUGAR on top, like, as a meal. After a while of searching and searching for a good, healthy, edible meal, and finding only cracker pizza and Jolibee fried chicken, things can start to feel reeeal bleak.\n\nIt got to the point where I began to dread lunch time… I LOVE lunch time.", "There are exceptions to the rule, and the food does seem to get better the further you get out of urban areas. All of the food on Camiguin was strangely delicious, so much so that I’m not fully convinced that island is actually IN the Philippines.\n\nKinilaw is like a delicious, fresh-fish, ginger ceviche, and I recommend it whenever you are near the sea. When the village comes together to create the mac daddy of them all, Lechon Baboy, (whole roast pig), then it’s REALLY something. There is absolutely excellent food to be had in the Philippines, but chances are you will only be able to access it 15% of the time you are there.\n\nAs sad as it made me, peanut butter and crackers were a god send."]

There have been some tragic accidents that have occurred on night buses, and some companies have shuttered as a result. If you have the time, traveling by day might be a safer option.", "Some of these buses have, inevitably gone cliff-side. So, you know, if someone’s leaning a little too heavy on their lead foot, don’t be afraid to insist they slow it the fuck down. Ain’t nobody trying to fall off a cliff in the Philippines. Gives a new meaning to the whole “hanging coffins” thing."]

I did experience a few questionable changes in disposition upon check in once it was understood that my partner and I would be sharing the bed, but nothing that made me feel I was in any danger.", "Baka is the Tagalog word for a man who has feminine mannerisms, or dresses or identifies as a woman and doesn’t always mean “gay”, but is often recognized as denoting a sort of third gender, rather than a homosexual male.", "The Philippines is considered one of the most gay friendly country in Asia. While that wasn’t my personal experience, I think it is a country gay people should be comfortable visiting and should absolutely check out the gay scene in Manila, which as far as I’m concerned was the best part of my experience in that city. “The Library” in Malate is a good place to start."]
