    "texts": ["In general, Peru is a safe country to travel in. Crime can occur in the bigger cities and economic inequality can lead to theft, especially in cities. Exercise the usual precautions when traveling abroad and you should be able to steer clear of any real danger. It’s always wise to use lockers if they are available in your hotel rooms. Walking alone through poorly lit areas of the cities, or along deserted beaches at night is never a great idea, and solo travelers (particularly females) can benefit from only using taxi’s from trusted sources… ie, your hotel, or official airport taxis.\n\nSome airlines have shaky safety records so it doesn’t hurt to do a little investigating beforehand if you’re thinking about buying a ticket on an airline you’ve never heard of.\n\nIf you’re going to the Amazon, keep in mind that literally everything that bites can kill you. Check your shoes, bed, and clothing before putting anything on."]

    "texts": ["While MOST of the traffic accidents reported in Peru occur in the cities and are largely due to speeding violations, or drunk-driving, intercity fatalities along highways do occur with more regularity than would be liked. There are a number of things to be cognizant of, and to take into consideration when preparing for a trip in Peru.", "If you are planning on driving yourself, make sure you only drive during the day. Roads are poorly marked and visibility is tough at night. Especially in rural areas. The conditions of the road can go from brand new to disheveled in the blink of an eye. It’s imperative that you travel with spare tires, parts, and fuel if you’re going to attempt to go it alone. Make sure you are insured to the teeth in case of an accident.", "Fog is common on coastal and mountain highways, and the resulting poor visibility frequently causes accidents. Land-slides and heavy rains make driving in the wet season particularly hazardous. In some instances the rain and flooding can get so bad that highways close, and cars get washed away. On some of the more remote mountain passes, rock-slides can block roadways for hours causing traffic to back up with little room to maneuver around or even back-track. If you’re unfortunate enough to get stuck in this scenario, brace yourself for a long wait.", "Long distance buses have their fair share of dangers especially at night, from sleepy (or drunk) bus drivers to close encounters with wayward herd animals (seriously… RIP chivo). Night-time bus-jackings have been known to occur on more remote routes along the highways, although these days this is not so common, and the presence of better security on the higher-end bus lines has tightened things up a bit. As a general rule it’s better to go with the more reputable bus lines since they closely monitor the hours and conditions of their drivers and vehicles."]

    "texts": ["The biggest danger posed by Mother Nature in Peru is the flash-flood. In 2017 the wet season was out-of-control violent and resulted in over 150 deaths, 500+ injured, and 20 missing persons during the heaviest days of rainfall. Cars disappeared, houses were swallowed, and the Pan-American highway had to be shut-down for nearly a month. On top of the immediate casualties, the cessation of running water greatly affected a huge portion of the coastal areas of the country, leading to major sanitary concerns.", "While rains like this aren’t particularly common, in typically dry, low-lying areas like the north-west coastal region of Peru, flash-floods can happen in… well… a flash. If you’re traveling during the rainy season and there is any sign that the area you are traveling in is going to be hit hard, consider relocating quickly.\n\nIn 2017 we got stuck in Huanchaco for over a week before being able to secure a flight to Lima, and away from the affected area. Shortly after our flight they shuttered the airport, leaving thousands stranded in panicked isolation. When the shit hits the fan it’s every man for himself, and even the airport started to feel a little scary. NOT how you want to spend your time in Peru.", "Rockslides can be a common occurrence in the mountains."]

    "texts": ["Much of Peru’s most exhilarating and inspirational sites are found at high elevation. If you aren’t accustomed to it, elevation sickness can come on quick and really impair your basic functionality. It can affect people in different ways, but some of the basic things to watch out for are:\n\nAn inability to sleep\nDizziness\nHeadache\nFatigue\nLoss of Appetite\nVomiting", "The best way to avoid getting altitude sickness is to ascend slowly. Making your way from the coast up to the mountains slowly will help stave off the worst of the symptoms. Give yourself a few days to adjust to the heights before embarking on a big trek. If you think you might have fallen victim to altitude sickness, take it easy. Don’t drink alcohol, try to rest, and consider moving a few hundred meters lower if you can. Once you start feeling better you can continue on your way to the top.", "In Peru, there are numerous free-hikes you can embark on, or hikes where hiring a guide isn’t required. If you choose to go it alone, without a guide, please keep a few things in mind.\n\nDON’T hike by yourself. At least bring a friend along. You may go long stretches without seeing another soul and help can be hard to come by. Make sure someone knows where you are headed, and do some research.", "While some hikes may SEEM straight-forward, much of Peru’s numerous hiking trails are poorly marked, or not marked at all and GPS can not be relied upon to provide accurate mapping of the mountains. If it’s not a well-trodden path, and you aren’t sure you know exactly where you’re going, hire a guide. It could make all the difference."]

OK, dramatic, but really the difference is stark. While it’s easy to differentiate between the two, it’s also easy to accidentally walk a few blocks too far and suddenly find yourself on the wrong side of town. Try to map out your route when exploring town so you have a better idea of the areas you should avoid, especially after dark.", "Lima in particular can get seedy at night. Solo travelers and especially females should take care when walking around. Unfortunately taxi’s (and taxi impersonators) have been known to occasionally cause problems for tourists unaware of the danger they could be facing. If you can, try to have your hostel/hotel/restaurant arrange a taxi for you rather than hailing one yourself.", "If you do hail a taxi, make sure it’s an official one with documentation to prove it. Getting taken to a shady side of town and robbed is not the worst thing that could happen should you end up in the wrong cab.", "In general you should not be afraid to travel in Peru. Peruvian people are, on a whole, an extremely friendly bunch and look out for each other as well as those visiting their country. Using common sense will go a long way to preventing any problems you may have. Keep your valuables secured and hidden, and avoid flashy jewelry, expensive looking cameras or phones, and keep your bags with you at all times. If you don’t seem an easy target, most opportunists will simply move on."]
