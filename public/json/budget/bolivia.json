If you have been traveling in Chile before coming to Bolivia you can pretty much count on slicing your budget in half.\n\nOf course, as with most places in the world, if you’re paying less in cash, you’re probably making up for it by paying with your time. Travel in Bolivia is slow moving, and not without it’s frustrations. You’ll want to consider budgeting more in the way of TIME than money to really enjoy all that this country has to offer."

    "texts": ["As with most countries, it’s the tourist sites that’ll go the farthest in eating away at your savings. Because Bolivia’s infrastructure is, generally speaking, less developed than some of its neighbors, getting around can sometimes be complicated and time consuming. As a result, many people will opt to join tours that iron out all those details rather than navigating the public transit system to get around. Note that this may solve a lot of your planning woes, but it’s going to cost considerably more than if you were to get around on your own.", "In some places, like the Amazon, or Uyuni, joining a guided tour is really the only option, and while you can shop around the different companies to compare the price, at the end of the day the bottom line is the bottom line, and you don’t want to haggle too hard if you’re expecting to have a good experience. Some tour operators cut costs by either underpaying their employees, or cutting corners on safety, either way… NO BUENO. If the price sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Go with your gut when selecting which tour operator to go with, and remember, even if it’s a little more expensive than the guys down the road, you’re eating lunch for $1.50 most days, so you’ll be fine."]

Finding a traditional lunch for as low as $1 USD is common place.", "These days a ton of new, “western-style” or fusion restaurants are popping up all over Bolivia.

A nice, sit down meal can be had for $5-10.", "All booze is cheap. Beer is $1.5 per half liter.

The occasional “VIP” bus service can be found if you do a little digging, and are willing to pay extra.","Inter-city flights between regional capitals will cost you around $80 USD each way, while smaller prop planes flying to more remote regions like the Amazon may be $100-150 each way depending on the season and availability.","Taxi’s are cheap.
