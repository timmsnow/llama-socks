    "texts": "Like all places in the world, your budget in Kenya will depend greatly on how much you want to see, how quickly you need to get around, and how comfortable you want your surroundings to be. Having said that, Kenya is one of the few countries in East Africa that really has some good mid-range options for those without the funds for a blow-out, but a little hesitant to rough it.\n\nIf you are strategic, have a high threshold for pain, and time is on your side, you can have an amazing budget trip in Kenya and average spending about $50 a day. If you maybe prefer the ensuite room, are OK with shelling out a little extra for a private car or two here and there, and allow yourself the standard 2-3 Tuskers a day, then you can absolutely crush your Kenya trip for an average of $100 a day.\n\nThis average is taken with some days spending much, much less, and other days spending shit tons. Conserve where you can, you will double your budget on safari days."

    "texts": ["The main thing to remember about accommodation in Kenya is that YOU WILL RARELY BE THERE. Most game drives start around 5 or 6 am, and last until sundown. A typical day in Kenya will have you feeling so beat you’ll want to go to bed halfway through dinner. This makes it a little silly to dole out a ton of cash on your digs. As long as the property is safe and comfortable, theres no reason for you to spend an arm and a leg. Save your money for park fees and safari guides, you’ll need it!", "It’s relatively easy to find a single room for $10 in Nairobi and elsewhere, but don’t count on it being pretty. Mid-range places in the city tend to run from $50-100 for a double but are generally more than comfortable, and often include breakfast in some shape or form.", "Diani Beach, for example, is a little on the pricier side, but there are gems to be found. Most hotels will include a breakfast option. There are a wide assortment of luxury options, and a few midrange and budget hotels. In some places you can find packages that include activities like Kite Surfing lessons or diving, although these tend to be pricey.", "Most of the accommodation in and around the national parks will be priced WITH board. Generally all 3 meals and your room included. It requires a bit of time to sort through whats on offer. They range from rustic accommodations for $75 per person including meals, all the way up to $1000 a night per person in some cases, depending on where you stay.\n\nWhile I am sure those places are nice, when you’re spending 12 hours of your day ON SAFARI, spending a small fortune on a bed for one night seems like an asshole thing to do. Give your money to someone who doesn’t have shoes."]

However, the majority I visited seemed to hover around $50 per person for entry into the park, with a nominal fee for the car (usually around $3-5 per vehicle). You can try and ask for a student discount, but the generally reserve those for School Groups as opposed to students on holiday.", "Because this sport is experiencing something of a boom of interest world-wide, the lessons come with a serious price tag. On the lower-end, courses hover around $300 USD for a three day certification course. Some of the swankier schools will average around $400-500 depending on your chosen package. It’s a good idea to comb the beaches and talk to a few different schools to see what kind of package works for you. Most schools are accommodating for people with less time or a tighter budget.", "National Park and camping fees for Mount Kenya will run you $150 for three days, $220 for a typical four-day hike, and $300 if you’re going for a five day experience. These are just the camp and entrance fees however, so guides, porters, and food will cost extra. There are loads of tour operators that can help organize your trip up the mountain, with costs depending on your required level of comfort."]

A half-pound of perfectly cooked Nyama Choma (bbq) and a plate of Ugali will typically set you back about $3-5. Throw in some spicy mixed samosas and a cold Tusker and that my friends, is heaven.", "The most important of them all. A half liter of Tusker will run you between $2-3 depending on where you’re buying. Cocktails do seem to exist in Kenya, especially in beach towns, but they are a bit more expensive. Fresh coconuts go for $1, sometimes less if the vendor is having a slow day. Bottled water can be bought in bulk, 8 liters or 16 liter bottles should keep you hydrated. They’re cheap.", "Most hotels and some restaurants in the more touristy areas will offer western fare, like burgers and pasta. Feel free to indulge occasionally but note that it’s typically mediocre, especially when compared with the flavorful local eats you can find on the coast. Western food is almost always more expensive, but I understand the one-off comfort meal.", "In hotels and resorts tips may be included. Otherwise, leaving around 10% when dining out is a good way to show your appreciation and make friends. Tipping your guides is imperative, as tips are a big part of a guides livelihood. Something like $10-15 USD per day is a good standard."]

If you have the time, you can take $3 matutus (small white minivans) from Nairobi to Dar es Salaam and have buckets of money leftover to grab all those wooden giraffe souvenirs you’ve been dying to tote around. Just be prepared to feel like you’ve aged a year for every hour on the road. When you take public transit you are putting your destiny in the hands of a driver who may or may not already know his van is going to break down halfway. Just don’t do it if you have a flight in the next 3 days.", "Domestic plane travel is cheap and will run you between $50-120 if you are flying between major cities. Much more if you are hopping on a charter plane to a National Park. Flights to Lamu can be as low as $30 USD.", "First class train tickets between Nairobi and Mombasa are $30, second class is $10. considering the amount of ground covered, the level of comfort, and the absence of traffic, this is some serious bang for your buck.", "The cost of renting a car can vary greatly depending on what you get. Don’t short-change yourself. GET A 4-WHEEL DRIVE. If you don’t, you will undoubtedly get stuck in a mud hole and a Rhinoceros will eat your spare tire before you even have time get in a fight with the schmuk you brought in the passenger seat. I ended up renting a great 4-Wheel drive from a local for about $70 a day. We had no problems."]
