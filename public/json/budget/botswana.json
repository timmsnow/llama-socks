    "texts": "Botswana is not something most people consider a low-cost, budget safari destination. In fact, it’s quite the opposite. A few decades ago it was decided that Botswana’s approach to tourism would be a little different than some of its neighbors. With the knowledge that mass tourism brings it’s own slew of issues, both environmental and humanitarian, the government has taken on a “low density, high-cost” tourism model. This means that just about everything related to tourism is high-end and expensive. Most lodges are luxury operations, and a good portion of the Delta, in particular, can only be accessed by plane or fancy tour. Even the campsites tend to cost more than in other countries (usually between $30-50 USD pp/pn). Luxury lodges are priced at per person rates, and can cost anywhere from $500-1500 per person, PER NIGHT.\n\nThe flip side of this is that Botswana remains a country with a very low tourist density. And less people = more magical encounters with wildlife.\n\nPlanning a budget conscious trip to Botswana IS possible without losing your life savings, but you do have to be careful. It’s important to come up with a strict budget and stick to it. Planning here is everything. If you try to wing it as you go along, you’ll easily find yourself in a financial tailspin."

    "texts": ["Finding a good cheap place to stay in the cities is pretty easy. The hotel/hostel scene is well-trodden and prices are competitive here. It’s when you head out to the remote corners that things (predictably) get trickier. Because of the isolation, you pay a premium for the creature comforts when you’re in the desert, or really, anywhere outside of the cities. It makes sense because it isn’t easy to schlep all the amenities hundreds of kilometers across barren landscapes and it costs the hotels money to do it. So if it’s top-of-the-line comfort you are after, be prepared to pay some serious dollars for it.", "If you’re staying at a lodge, tipping USD $10 per day for the staff is highly encouraged (and expected).","Mid-range accommodation is rare out here. My recommendation to anyone venturing out into the wilderness is to find a couple like-minded travelers and throw-in on a 4×4 with camping capabilities. Most of these vehicles will come with everything you need including bedding, cookware, and camping gear.", "Camping in Botswana is a little more nuanced than in other neighboring countries. You will need to pre-book your campsites in advance, ESPECIALLY in high season, as the low-density model means there are only a smattering of campsites in each national park. Despite campsite prices being higher in Botswana than in other countries, it is exponentially more expensive to stay in a lodge than to camp. Camping will reduce your accommodation budget considerably. If you spend 10 days camping for cheap, maybe you can splurge on some nice digs one or two nights along the way to clean yourself up.","In many cases, staying outside of the National park gates (even RIGHT outside) can cut the cost of your campsite or lodge considerably. If it isn’t too inconvenient, you may want to consider the options outside of the park."]

    "texts": ["In general the main things you will be spending money on are national park entry fees. Luckily in Botswana, for the most part the prices are reasonable. Most National Parks have the same blanket fees: 120 pula per person, per day (approx $12.50 USD). For the most part, you can pay your entry fees at the gate upon entering, however at some of the more remote gates in low season you may not, in which case you will need to have paid all park fees in advance at the park offices in Maun or Gaborone. This is rare, but if you’re feeling nervous about it feel free to pay your fees in advance. Also note that there are opening and closing times that you’ll need to adhere to. If you’re arriving late you might not be able to reach the park.","In addition, be aware that most parks will have a vehicle fee as well. This is a per-day fee that must be paid per vehicle. It’s generally not expensive (50 pula per day in most cases), but not completely inconsequential either. Splitting the costs with other travelers will be helpful.", "Unlike in some other countries, park entry is NOT based on a 24 hour period so if your accommodation is inside the park gates you will be paying the entry fee for every day that you are in the park. This means if you are spending one night in the park you must pay for 2 days of park fees, even if you leave the park early in the morning. Lodges and campsites outside of the national parks are generally MUCH cheaper than those inside and by staying outside of the park gates you can avoid any unnecessary park fees.","Tipping your safari/tour guides is expected and should be factored into your daily budget. USD $10 per day is a good general rule to follow. Throwing in another $5 for any porters or drivers is also encouraged."]

Fill up on the good stuff while you’re here, cause you’ll be pretty much on your own once you leave.","Outside of the cities if you want to keep costs down you should consider self-catering. If you are going the 4×4 route you should include a gas cooker so you can prepare your meals under the stars. Plan simple meals with ingredients that don’t spoil easy. Most 4×4 fridges have enough room for perishables to last about 3 days. Plan on stocking your grocery supply accordingly. Some camp sites may even have Braai pits available to BBQ meat, although different rules apply for sourcing firewood depending on the park or region you are in. ", "Groceries and canned goods are not particularly cheap, and it’s easy to rack up a $100 USD grocery bill without even trying. Planning out a budget friendly menu is imperative. Try to re-use ingredients for several meals so you can buy in bulk, and stick to easy meals with a max of 5-6 ingredients. Supplement your meals with cheap snacks like biltong and peanut butter and you’ll be all set.", "After a week or so on the road, you may want to treat yourself to a meal cooked by someone else. Bear in mind that restaurants in the desert are rare and not always the cheapest, especially at the lodges. If you do want a restaurant meal, get it when you’re passing through a town or city.

If you split the cost four ways, the total for a rental could be as cheap as $30 a day per person… for EVERYTHING. That means you’ll be keeping your accommodation AND your transit costs way down so you can spend a little extra when you need to.", "Bus travel isn’t bad either. A 9 hour bus from Johannesburg to Gaborone is priced around $27 USD. Not bad all things considered.", "The roads in Botswana are pretty impressively maintained. The major highways are sealed, and even the non-tarred roads seem to be in reasonably good shape. You could, in theory, save some money buy renting a non four-wheel-drive vehicle, since a good portion of the country wouldn’t require it. Places like Etosha National Park can be explored in a standard rental vehicle, however, make sure you have mapped out exactly which route you’ll be taking to avoid any surprises along the way. I’d still reccommend the 4×4 for anyone camping, but if you’re hopping from lodge to lodge, you might be ok with a cheaper vehicle.", "Gas in Botswana is cheaper than in some of the surrounding countries, so it’s a good idea to fill up here as opposed to South Africa, or Zambia (if you have a multi-country itinerary). It’s about 95 pula a liter for diesel fuel… so if you’re driving a double tank 4×4, you can count on spending somewhere in the ballpark of $140 USD to fill the tank. OUCH! Painful I know, but with a full tank you should be able to keep moving for about 1000 kilometers."]
