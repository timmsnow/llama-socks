Everyone knows where it is. Alternatively you can go to the center of town and catch the FREE blue buses to the port. This is a great option if you want to check out the beautiful Baiturrahim Mosque that’s featured in the center of town. The bus stops have maps telling you which way to go, but most people in town are curious about foreign travelers and it is likely that you will be approached by someone genuinely wanting to show you the way. I found everyone in Banda Aceh to be exceedingly friendly.", "If all goes well and you make it to the port, you’ll see there is a fast ferry and a slow ferry. The fast ferry takes about 45 minutes and leaves at 8 am, 10 am, and 4pm most days. The slow ferry is about 1.5 hours and departs at 11 am and 4pm. These schedules are not exact and it would be a good idea to arrive earlier than later just in case something has changed.

Mantas, Whale Sharks, and Mola Molas have all been known to grace these waters and particularly impressive is the Sophie Rickmers wreck dive, situated 50 meters below the surface. The diving here is cheaper than in other equally impressive locations, with regular dives starting around $25 USD that get cheaper when bought in bulk as packages. Local shore dives can be as cheap as $17 USD. It’s easy to spend a week here, diving every day. I highly recommend Lumba Lumba divers on Gapang Beach.

As terrifying of a thought as that is, there are a few guesthouses who sneakily provide that sweet sweet sugar-water to guests who ask politely. It’s generally just beer and/or wine, and it’s definitely more expensive than you’ll find outside of Aceh, but consider it a finders fee.

My Uber experience in Indonesia was spotty. It seems to be somewhat of a gray area with the government. Though it was legal when I was traveling there in 2018, there were only certain cities in which it was available. In some parts of Indonesia, groups of taxi driver “unions” have been known to intimidate and threaten ride-sharing drivers in an effort to stop their operation. I recommend taking it on a case by case basis. Basically, I would not count on it.", "The alternative is striking a deal with a taxi driver directly.

If you have your sights set on a deep jungle hike, you may want to consider the hike from Bukit Lawang to Ketambe, on the other side of the National Park. This will take you into the interior but will ensure the need for more supplies, and thus more porters, making your hike considerably more expensive.

It’s a good idea to meet with your guide the day before to go over the itinerary and the finer details of what to expect on the trek.

The easiest way to do this is to arrange a pickup with your accommodation, which, do to the remote location and the effort involved in getting there, you may want to book in advance.\n\nIf you’re starting your journey from somewhere outside of Sulawesi, get ready because even getting to Palu can mean a flight to Makassar with a connection to Palu, and again, more room for delays and missed travel opportunities.

YAY!", "Diving in Komodo is not the best place for a beginner diver to get their feet wet, so to speak. While there are areas of the park that err on the calmer side, because of its geographic location set in a channel that runs straight through the Indonesian island chain, you can pretty much count on some serious currents coming in throughout the day. These currents can be a little unpredictable, and can change at the drop of a fin. In addition to regular tidal movements, Komodo has some serious upswells and down swells that make having control of your buoyancy imperative. If you haven’t dived in awhile, taking a refresher might be a good idea.\n\nAlways listen to your dive guide, and take their warnings seriously. While the guides in the Komodo area are experienced and knowledgeable, every diver is accountable for their own safety. If you don’t feel comfortable with a dive plan, don’t dive."]

      "texts": ["One of the great, fabled backpacker adventures of Indonesia is the boat cruise from Lombok to Flores that makes stops in Komodo along the way. It’s an unforgettable journey through some of the least visited and sparsely populated regions of Indonesia. You can choose between simple on-deck open air sleeping, or private and semi-private cabins, but both options come with meals included, fiery sunsets, and impossibly starry skies.", "Again there are multiple itineraries for this trip, and a plethora of tour operators to choose from. The basic set up of the trip is a three day journey from the East coast of Lombok to Labuanbajo (or vice versa), although some of the trips deviate a bit with an extra day or two added to explore other islands. A lot of people organize their trips beforehand, but I found it to be quite easy to navigate on my own, in person, once I arrived. Both Bali and the Gili Islands are great places to shop around for the tour that suits you. You can opt for a one way trip or a return, but there are some things to consider before you commit.", "In this instance… Bigger is Better. These waters are notoriously tricky to navigate. There are tidal currents and all kinds of seasonal wildness happening in the seas around this part of Indonesia and storms can pop up out of nowhere. Over the years, this journey has had some terrifying and a few actually tragic accidents involving sinking boats and drowning tourists. The bigger the boat, the better equipped it is to handle whatever nature has to throw at it.", "You can haggle, but don’t skimp on safety. Again, take your safety seriously. There are a ton of tour operators out there and some of them will advertise too-good-to-be-true prices. Don’t go for the cheapest option here, do a little research online and see if you can’t find a reputable company with good reviews and a solid safety record. Even if you don’t end up going with them it can be a good start for comparing prices with other companies. Perama is a well-known company and a good starting point.", "The food on the boat is generally going to be lack-luster. Bring snacks, lots of them, and also consider whether or not you can handle more than 3 or 4 days of extremely basic sustenance.", "Likewise the sleeping arrangements may not be something you want to commit to for a long period of time. There have been known to be some “bait and switch” situations where the cabin that was promised to you is suddenly not available when you arrive at the boat. If you can, get your agreement in writing, or at least a detailed receipt describing the type of accommodation you paid for. It doesn’t hurt to hold on to the phone numbers of the tour operators as well, in case you need to go straight to the source to get things ironed out.", "If you spend a little time getting organized this journey will likely be one of the highlights of your entire travel career. You’ll be stopping at uninhabited islands with sublime empty beaches, calcified waterfalls and snorkeling in pristine aqua-marine sea water, not to mention getting a free ride right up to Komodo Island’s doorstep. If you were planning on paying for a tour to Komodo anyway, just think of this as an added bonus.\n\nEven if there is a little sticker shock at first, keep in mind that this trip is your transit, food, accommodation, and activities for a solid 3-4 days. Coupled with the added benefit of embarking on an incredibly unique and delightful experience, it’s safe to say that for a budget traveler, it doesn’t really get better than that."]

The rooms are airy, light, clean, and spacious. All of the rooms are outfitted with aircon, which you might want to consider since opening the window in dusty, somewhat noisy Labuanbajo can be problematic. Breakfast is included in the price of the room and there’s a fantastic rooftop where you can eat your breakfast and enjoy a beer while you watch the sunset. Pretty perfect. Doubles go for about $30 USD per night.", "I’m actually recommending this place not as a place to sleep, but as an optional day activity if you’re looking for a nice escape from the mild chaos of Labuanbajo. This resort offers day passes for people in need of a good flop on the beach. It’s a quiet area, with great swimming water and an onsite restaurant. They even offer shuttle services for pickups/drop offs to Labuanbajo. Just call them to arrange a pickup. It’s a great way to spend a free day."]

      "texts": "The Unesco World Heritage site of Borobudur lies just outside of Indonesia’s cultural capital, Yogyakarta. Built in the 8th century and thought to have taken 75 years to complete, this is the largest Buddhist structure in the world. It’s a masterpiece and speaks strongly of the human capacity to build in harmony with nature. Views of the surrounding countryside from the top of the complex are faaaaaantastic, and not soon to be forgotten.\n\nThough largely forgotten by Indonesians after the mass conversions to Islam in the 15th century, Borobudur has been rediscovered and is now widely considered to be one of the most important historical sites in the country. Nearby Prambanan temple is an equally impressive Hindu site on on the other side of Yogyakarta, and well worth a visit. It’s slightly easier to get to and I’ll outline how to do it in a separate section below."

Most people plan their trip from Yogyakarta, which is only about 40 kms outside of the city center.", "Taking the public bus to Borobudur is fairly straight forward. You should budget about 2 hours in each direction.\n\nSTEP 1- The first step is to get to the Jombor Bus terminal in the northern part of the city. You can take the trans-Jogja local city buses to Jombor using bus 2A or 2B.\n\nSTEP 2- Once you’ve made it to Jombor you can ask at the bus station which bus to take to Borobudur. The bus will make a short stop in Muntilan village to drop off/pick up more passengers before continuing on to Borobudur. You can pay your fare on the bus once you’ve started the journey.\n\nSTEP 3- Once you arrive in Borobudur station, walk through the small cluster of food stalls and souvenir shops and make a left on the main road, the complex is only about 100 meters up the road.\n\nThis is the cheapest method for reaching the temple complex, but keep in mind that once the buses BACK to Yogyakarta stop running fairly early. If you are arriving later in the day, it’s best to head back before the complex closes, since the last bus back leaves before dark. I stayed to watch the sunset and got stranded. I ended up having to get creative with my ride back to the city. (mix of moto-taxis and ride-sharing)", "Day tours can be organized with any tour company in the city. They range in price depending on whats included but can be an extremely convenient way to get to and from the complex (no worry about being stranded here!).\n\nSome of the tours include trips to Prambanan temple as well. If you don’t get burned out on temple-wandering, this could be a good option to knock out two birds with one stone."]

This will save you a little bit of money and get you through the door quicker.", "The complex is open from 6am-5pm daily. There is a sunrise-tour available for those itching to see watch the sun come up over the temple. It’s operated by the Manohara Hotel and will cost you 450,000 IDR for non-guests, or 250,000 for those staying at the hotel.", "One of the big benefits to the sunrise tour is that you will avoid any crowds, especially the school children who descend in droves on the complex throughout the day. These school children are sweet, but relentless, and generally want to spend their time taking selfies with foreigners and practicing their english. Regardless of if you opt for the sunrise tour or not, it can be a good idea to arrive right when they open, or an hour or so before they close to try and avoid the crowds.\n\nOn certain holidays the complex plays host to light shows and orchestral music. I haven’t done it, but it sounds magical."]
