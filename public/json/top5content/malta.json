By day, the well-kept narrow streets play host to a steady throng of day-trippers who come to the town for a Maltese history lesson (and some excellent photo opportunities).\n\nMdina may be the most picturesque and atmospheric town in Malta. Set on a hill, and geographically in the middle of the island, the views found from the top of the city’s walls are expansive. At night the town feels deserted and romantic, as the city lights bounce shadows off the bastions and a sustained quiet blankets the town.\n\nJust outside the gates of the fortified city is the sister city of Rabat. While Rabat may not have the majesty of its walled counterpart, there is a hushed beauty that snakes its way through its winding streets and classic Maltese architecture. Everything here can be seen on foot, and there is enough going on here to keep you busy for a couple of days. Spending a night or two in Rabat will give you a feel for the quiet, but jovial atmosphere of the town at night, and provides the perfect respite for anyone seeking an escape from the bar crawls and discos in towns like Valletta, Sliema, or St Juliens."]

Malta was on the receiving end of constant bombing and a good portion of the city was turned to rubble. Miraculously the city withstood the attacks despite having almost no aerial defenses and went on to play a vital role in turning the tide of the war in the Mediterranean.\n\nNowadays, the city is THE tourist hub of the islands. In fact, it feels as though very few Maltese actually live in Valletta, opting to stay further outside of the city and away from the hordes of tourists that come to visit during the day. At night things calm down a bit, although there is a healthy nightlife scene here, especially on the weekends when lively (drunk) crowds spill out into the street to (drunkenly) enjoy the night air.\n\nThere’s no doubt that she’s a pretty lady, and despite the day time crowds it’s actually a great place to base yourself during your time in Malta.
