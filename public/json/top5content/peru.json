Excited? You really should be. This is one of the those places in the world where words, pictures, and drone footage don’t cut it. Regardless of how many people you know who have been, or how many articles you’ve read, once you arrive on this magic mountain it’ll feel like you’re seeing in color for the very first time.\n\nThis masterful piece of Incan ingenuity and artistic expression is pretty much guaranteed to knock those newly acquired, hand stitched, Peruvian llama socks RIGHT off your aching clodhoppers. Now this ain’t the easiest monument to reach, nor is it the cheapest. You can also count on sharing the views with several thousand other people. But even with the crowds, the misty air lends itself perfectly to the drama of the ancient site and you’ll want to spend hours basking in the mystique of this accurately classified “new wonder of the world”."]

There is no transportation option that will take you _directly_ to the site, instead you have to make a stop in the small town of Aguas Calientes at the base of the mountain. While it IS possible to visit the site in a day from Cusco or Ollantaytambo, it requires a bit of exhaustive travel and you won’t be able to maximize your time at the site. The BEST way to visit this incredible city is to spend at least one night in Aguas. Although it’s a town pretty much entirely devoted to the river of tourists that flow through it on their way to the site, the misty mountain atmosphere and the access to the local hot springs sweeten the deal substantially.\n\nThe reason you can’t just hop on a bus and head straight to Machu Picchu is because there is no access road directly connecting Aguas Calientes with to Ollantaytambo or Cuzco.

Both companies offer train services running from Ollantaytambo and Cuzco, with varying degrees of class and price. Both options are expensive, in fact this train is known to be the most expensive train in the world based on price per kilometer, however Peru Rail is owned by foreign investors, meaning the majority of the profit generated does not stay in Peru, while Inca Rail IS a Peruvian owned train and therefore more likely to recycle the profits into the Peruvian economy. Food for thought. Regardless of which company you choose, it’s a good idea to reserve tickets in advance since the trains can get booked up.", "If you are planning your trip from Cuzco you will need to make your way to the Poroy train station, about 12 km from the city center. This means taking a taxi to the station, which should cost between 20-30 soles and the price should be agreed upon before entering the taxi. The area around the Poroy Station tends to feel mildly dodgy, so it’s better not to linger. The station itself is safe enough, plan to arrive about 30 minutes before the train is meant to depart. Travel time from Poroy Station to Aguas Calientes is about 3 hours and 45 minutes. You’ll want a window seat since you can expect some unforgettable views of the Sacred Valley from the train. Keep in mind the Poroy route is closed from December-March due to the rainy season.", "If you have a little more time and plan to spend a night or two in Ollantaytambo, which I highly recommend, you can pick up the train from here and the travel time will be shorter and much cheaper. From the town center it’s an easy walk downhill to the train station. Again, you’ll want to arrive about 30 mins prior to departure, and book your tix in advance. If you plan taking the bus there and only taking the train on the way back, you will want to grab your return ticket before you leave for Aguas.

This was honestly one of the more terrifying rides I experienced in Peru. It’s OK to ask for them to slow down if you think things may be getting out of hand, but whether or not they’ll pay you any mind is another thing.

Because these shuttles don’t leave until they are full, you may be able to negotiate the price a little.", "Alternatively you can take public buses from Ollantaytambo but they are generally coming from Cusco and may already be full. Additionally, you will need to stop in Santa Teresa to change buses. This is marginally cheaper, but will eat up a good bit of your day, so unless you are planning on spending a night in Santa Teresa I recommend taking the tourist shuttle.", "Once in HydroElectrica, it’s about an hour and a half walk along the tracks, and depending on the weather, it could be muddy, rainy, misty, or simply gorgeous. Obviously you’ll want to bring comfortable walking shoes, as you’ll be making your way across mud and rocks and railroad track bridges. But the path is simple to follow and you won’t be alone, since there will be plenty of other budget-minded backpackers plying the same rocky route, like new age pilgrims heading to their southern Shangri-la.

This means you have to accurately time your bus or trek up the mountain, allowing for any queues that may exist in the bus parking lot or at the bathroom.\n\n2 - There are a limited number of tickets sold for each time slot, meaning the more coveted time slots will sell quickly.

Meaning, If you want to stay longer than 4 hours, you will have to buy TWO separate ticket time slots.\n\nIf you only plan on staying in the main area of the site, you might be ok, however this new rule makes it particularly difficult if you are planning on partaking in any of the additional hikes on offer, like Huayna Picchu or Machu Picchu Mountain (Montaña for short). Both hikes will run you between 2-3 hours round trip, leaving only a small amount of time for you to tour the rest of the site.

You can arrange a guide beforehand, or hire one at the entrance gate.\n\nThis rule may not be as strictly enforced as the others, and I have heard reports of people exploring the site on their own in 2019, but you should come prepared to hire a guide if you get stopped.\n\nYou can expect to pay about $20 USD a head for your guide, though the actual price depends on the size of your group.", "Previously it was estimated that around 5,000 people a day made the trip to Machu Picchu.

However, a path IS open for those wanting to view the bridge from a short distance. If you’re interested in taking in some stunning mountain scenery while simultaneously practicing controlled breathing exercises to ward off the vertigo-induced panic attacks, then this is the path for you!\n\nThe bridge is a shorter walk from the center of Machu Picchu than the other optional hikes, and takes about 25 minutes to reach.

This is a small consolation for not being able to fly, so if you think you can power through with a little dramamine, give it a go. The tower can be reached by taxi or public bus."]

You would then be able to hop right over to the airport, peep the lines, and be on your merry way to your next destination by lunch time. However, keep in mind that with this approach you will most certainly be exhausted and probably less than enthusiastic about doing ANYTHING, let alone tumbling through the air in a single prop plane above a vast arid desert. Not to mention, two long distance buses in one day? GIVE YOURSELF A BREAK. I recommend spending at least one night in Nazca. Then you’ll have the chance to check out some of these lesser known sights that are on offer here.", "This remote collection of tombs is Peru’s only collection of ancient mummies that are still housed in their original tombs. It’s a pretty spooky place and it’s not crowded at all. Spending an hour or so walking between the tombs and checking out the remains of (still haired) human skulls, and ceramic artifacts that date back over 1,000 years ago is pretty terrifying and fun. If you’re not on an organized tour really the only way to visit is to negotiate a taxi to take you there and back. Most taxi drivers are happy to wait while you explore the area. Just agree on the price beforehand.", "This is thought to be the highest sand dune in the world. Most visitors to Cerro Blanco will either come with the intention of sand boarding, or riding in a dune buggy. Either way this can only be done with a tour operator, and it’s not a bad idea to go early to try and avoid the mid-day sun.", "This is a collection of ancient irrigation aqueducts. I recommend a visit to this site for the MOST NERDY among us, as this may not be all that interesting for everyone else involved. Visits can be organized easily in town.", "In addition to the regular 40 minute flight over Nazca, many of the airlines will offer an optional extended flight over the lesser known “Palpa Lines.” Created with the same technique as the Nazca Lines, the Palpa lines are extremely beautiful and complex geometric shapes, and well worth the extra $. You can negotiate the price of the visit for around $40-50 more."]

When you are in the presence of greatness, the air around you feels heavy and powerful. Every new mountain climbed offers a peek backward into the history of this extraordinary land and its people. This is the spiritual center of Peru, and in addition to its old world atmosphere, a strong, witchy, new age vibration runs through the tiny towns and settlements that dot the ridges of the region.\n\nWhile it’s mostly famous as the home of the insanely well-preserved monument city of Machu Picchu, the entire valley is littered with scores of remarkable ruins running up and down it’s alpine ridges, most of which barely see any visitors apart from a few intrepid souls looking to dig a little deeper, and be all the more rewarded for it. Regardless of how deep you dive, any trip to this magic landscape will leave you wishing you had more time, and might possibly lead to you extending your trip.

It’s the ancient capital and beating heart of the once powerful Incan Empire, and you can feel the energy as soon as you arrive. Because it’s a rather large city, and an extremely popular destination, it’s pretty easy to get here. There’s an “all roads” kind of quality to Cuzco which makes it easy to access from just about anywhere. That being said, distances in Peru are massive, and the roads here aren’t always the best maintained.", "If you’re coming straight from Lima, or anywhere on the coast for that matter, do yourself a favor and fly. One-way tickets are extremely affordable and you’ll have some lovely views as you soar over the Andes on your way into town. The flight should only take about an 1.5-2 hours, while a bus from Lima will run you a back-breaking 24 hours. Seriously, it’s not worth it.\n\nOne thing to consider when flying into Cuzco however is that it is a city at altitude. At over 3,000 meters, if you are coming directly from sea level, you may want to give yourself a few days to acclimatize before setting off on any serious hikes or strenuous activity. Altitude sickness is no joke, so if you find yourself feeling under the weather, take meds, get sleep, and don’t go hiking.", "Now, if you are on a longer trip and find yourself bussing your way around Peru, a slow climb up to Cuzco is the best way to acclimatize yourself gradually. I recommend first stopping in Arequipa, which is about 1000 meters lower, before continuing onward to Cuzco.\n\nMost buses into Cuzco will be overnight buses, meaning you’ll have a nice early morning arrival into town. This could be VERY early, like 4 or 5 am. It’s not a bad idea to wait until the sun comes up before making your way through the town to your hotel if you’re traveling on foot. Cruz del Sur is by far the most comfortable bus company in Peru. If you book early enough you should be able to get one of the fully reclining seats on the bottom floor of the bus. Super worth it."]

You can usually find them around the main square of any given town.\n\nMost of them will have some kind of signage indicating their route, but it never hurts to double check with the driver, and confirming the cost isn’t a bad idea either. This is the best way to get around if you’re making multiple stops to different villages in the valley.", "Hiking is the other alternative. The Sacred Valley is famous for being the home of the Inca Trail. This “trail” actually has multiple routes that vary in length and difficulty. To walk the trails you must have a licensed guide. It’s important to research each trail to make sure it’s the kind of thing you really want to commit to. Keep in mind your hiking days will be long ones, and it’s almost surely a cold, hard, possibly WET tent you’ll be sleeping in over night. While the idea of the trail is all very romantic and can be a fantastic way to see the countryside, make sure you’ve dotted your i’s etc, and really know what you’re getting into.

Student discounts are available for those with ISIC cards. The boleto will get you access to all the major sites in the valley, such as Sacsayhuamán, Qénqo, Pukapukara, Tambomachay, Chinchero and the ruins of Pisac, Ollantaytambo, Tipon and Pikillacta.", "Charming little Ollanta (for short) is about a 2 hours drive from Cuzco and was once a dominant regional power center for the Inca people. Sandwiched between two giant mountain ridges, the town itself is a minuscule, walkable little cobblestone situation that’s absurdly picturesque. A great deal of your travel can be arranged from Ollanta, and when you’re ready, this is the best jump off point for getting to Machu Picchu. Budget an extra day here to explore the exceptional ruins that hug the mountainside.", "The Capital city is absolutely ground zero for all of your Sacred Valley endeavors. It’s full of gorgeous colonial architecture, and has a voracious appetite for the arts and gastronomy. The central Market is a fantastic place to score some hand-knitted llama socks, and spending a few days wandering the ruins on the periphery of town, including the impressive Incan fort of Sacsayhuamán is the perfect way to whet your Incan whistle.", "Little Chinchero is about as cute as they come, and that’s really saying something when we’re comparing Andean mountain towns. There is a small colonial center that opens up to a plateau of striking Incan ruins and mountain vistas. You’ll need the boleto turistico to enter the old town.", "This hippied out little village sits in a valley under some serious Incan ruins. Following the trails up the mountain from town you’ll encounter what looks like an almost mini-Machu Picchu. Except that the entry is covered by your boleto turistico, and there’s barely anyone there.", "This little freak of the valley situated in-between Urubamba and Chinchero is a cross between ancient rice terraces and a great salt pan. This salt farm, perched on the side of a cliff, still operates as it has for thousands of years. Getting here with public transit can take a little time, but ultimately it’s worth the time effort.", "Less of a highlight than an optional extra curricular, the only real reason to visit Santa Teresa is to access the fantastic Aguas Thermales de Cocalmayo which are about a mile outside of town.
