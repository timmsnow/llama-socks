The discrepancy lies in the geography of La Paz itself, which is built into a deep canyon on the edge of the altiplano (high plateau). The majority of the city rests at a whopping 3,100 meters above sea level, but portions, including the site for the international airport, go beyond that, reaching heights up to 4,000 meters. This means that in addition to the usual acclimatization woes (dizziness, shortness of breath, trouble sleeping), you’ll find yourself in all four seasons depending on the time of day and area of the city you’re in. It’s a hard city to dress for if you don’t have the right gear. Of course, it shouldn’t be too hard to do as the locals and sort yourself out with a hand-spun llama wool cloak or a hat. Never a bad idea in my book.\n\nWhile the city can sometimes feel crowded, chaotic, and intimidating, the last few decades have seen some major changes take place. New investment and the implementation of some serious infrastructural improvements is giving the city opportunities for rebirth in every sector. All along the major thoroughfare, the “Prado”, business is booming. New restaurants, art galleries, and marketplaces are ushering in a new era for the city’s nearly 3 million residents.\n\nThe city itself may surprise you with its natural beauty. There is a vastness to this city on the roof of the world, and it’s anything but short on wide, spell-binding views from the top. The newest addition to the city’s public transit system, the Teleferico, gives its riders the reward of 360° of picture-postcard panoramic perfection, an attraction in its own rite, all for about the same cost as the local bus. Prepare to be swept off your feet, La Paz is a surprisingly good dance partner."]

Nearly HALF. That means the runways have to be extra long in order to take off because of the extremely thin air. If that already leaves you feeling a little uneasy about shoving off by plane, also note that most long-distance planes are scheduled to leave EARLY in the morning because the air is slightly denser, and they often takeoff with minimal amounts of fuel, to keep the plane as light as possible, and stop elsewhere for a refuel later. So yeah, a bit terrifying.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind if you’re flying straight into La Paz is that you may have some issues with the altitude once you leave the safety of the pressurized airplane.

The price of the airport taxi’s are theoretically fixed at 70Bs (US $10), but it’s still a good idea to double check the fare before getting in the cab. Only accept a ride from a radio taxi at the airport.\n\nIf you’re up for a bit of an adventure you can catch the local bus 212 that runs directly in front of the terminal and spirits you away to the main bus terminal in the town center. It’s very cheap.", "The main bus terminal is at the northern end of the Prado and is of the usual South American bus terminal variety. It’s noisy, mildly chaotic, and contains a number of different bus companies and touts eager to get you on their bus. It’s not a bad idea to check some timetables and prices for your next destination while you’re here so you know what your options are when you’re ready to move on. There will be a departure tax to be paid before alighting the bus.\n\nWalking into the city center takes about 15 minutes and is a straight shot down the main drag. Alternatively taxi’s and mototaxis are happy to take you on if you’re feeling tired. There are, of course, local buses that run down the Prado as well, although trying your hand at navigating the public transit in La Paz on first arrival, with bags, can be a bit jarring."]

The entire building is well looked after, and the friendly staff is more than happy to hold your bags for you after check-out if you’re thinking about making a trip to las islas. Throw in a hot water shower, and you’ve got yourself a great budget option.", "There are a TON of budget options for those wishing to spend the night on Isla Del Sol (and you should). The truth of the matter is that the best way to find the right place for you could be to just show up and have a look around. There are many wonderful guesthouses that aren’t even listed online, meaning they are more likely to be cheaper, and available. Show up on the early side of the day and you’re sure to find something that suits you in both price and location.\n\nIf you do want to book your place in advance, that’s fine, but there are a few things to consider when looking for a room. For starters, the entire island is one giant mountain, and there is a lot of climbing involved no matter where you stay. The higher up, the better views, but of course, your bags won’t carry themselves to the hotel now will they? Also, hot running water is a rarity here. If you can go without a shower, no worries, if you need one, best to check before you book. The night-time temps here can be FRIGID."]

      "texts": "The Amazon Basin is an area of Bolivia that’s in stark contrast with the rest of the country. Low-lying, hot, wet, and teeming with wildlife, this is a truly massive and remote region. In fact, access to the area is limited to specific areas and can, at times, be difficult to sort out. But when there is a will, there’s a way, and all good things come with a little effort. The intrepid traveler willing to take a chance and brave the journey out to the jungle will find themselves surrounded with all kinds of opportunities for adventure unavailable anywhere else in Bolivia. Multi-day jungle tours, river cruises, animal encounters, and interactions with indigenous local communities are all on offer here.\n\nMost independent travelers will base themselves in the sleepy backwater of Rurrenabaque. It’s the easiest access point for the nearby Madidi National Park, and presents itself as a haven for the road-weary, would-be hammock loungers of the world. The town is packed to the gills with tour operators running trips into the jungle and the pampas, the two most popular areas for tourists coming here. Rurrenabaque is super chilled, if a little touristy, but makes for the perfect place to spend a few days getting things in order and chilling out before your Amazonian adventure begins."

      "texts": ["Generally speaking, the best time to visit the Bolivian Amazon is during the dry season from April to October. The reason for this is because the wet season can bring with it an unbearable amount of bugs that bite, and also make travel in the area go from difficult to nearly impossible. Traveling by bus means your chances of getting stuck in some serious mud increase ten fold. The bus trip is already a laborious affair so think twice before you commit in the rainy season.", "Getting to Rurrenabaque by plane is by far the easiest and least painful way to get here. You’ll pay more than you would traveling overland of course, but the chances of something going wrong are far less, and the time saved will be huge. Amaszonas Airlines has daily flights from La Paz that take about an hour. Tickets can be booked on their website, but it doesn’t always work. The less sketchier option is to book the flights in person at one of their offices in La Paz. Keep in mind that weather and maintenance lead to cancelations somewhat regularly. Always confirm your flight the day before, because… well, you just have to.\n\nOnce you’ve landed at the airport, the airline has a shuttle bus to run passengers into the center of town. Additionally, Moto-taxis will be waiting if you miss the shuttle for whatever reason.", "Taking the bus from La Paz to Rurrenabaque is truly an exercise in traveler stamina. This option is not for the faint of heart, or really anyone who loves themselves. So…BUY A FLIGHT.\n\nIf you’re determined however, get ready for a back-breaking bus ride of anywhere from 16-24 hours. This ride takes you down from the Altiplano into the basin and is subject to all kinds of unpredictable weather. Throw in an over-crowded bus and a speedy and possibly intoxicated bus driver, and you’ll start to get the picture. Bring food with you because well, it could be awhile, and you may not want to eat what’s on offer every time the bus makes a stop.\n\n…If it rains… good luck."]

Camping options are also available for those interested in getting down to the nitty gritty, with emphasis on the gritty.\n\nYou can expect to spend your time embarking on muddy jungle walks, learning about the local fauna and flora, and keeping an eye out for the wildlife of the jungle. Including a night walk in your itinerary is a good way to up your chances of animal encounters.", "Most companies charge around the same price (usually 1200 Bs) as the minimum cost of the tour has been set by the government to ensure fair pay and ecologically friendly practices. However, this doesn’t always ensure that the best practices are in fact being followed, so some of the responsibility has to fall on you as the consumer to educate yourself about what is proper behavior in the Jungle.\n\nIt pretty much goes without saying that manhandling any of the animals should be off the table. If you’re booking your experience with one of the community eco-lodges in the interior of the jungle like Mashaquipe or Chalalán you will probably pay a bit more, but you’ll know you are in good hands.","Guys, we need to take a minute to talk about the mosquitos. The mozzies of the Amazon are unlike anything you have ever encountered before. They are A- GINORMOUS, and B- they come in PLAGUES. If you are taking a jungle walk, cover yourself completely from head to toe in MULTIPLE layers, as these bastards can bite THROUGH your clothing. Also, bathe in mosquito repellent."]

This is mostly because wildlife is generally easier to spot in the open wetlands as opposed to the dense and dark canopy of the jungle. These trips are usually designed to last 2-3 days. Night-time canoe excursions can be a particularly fascinating experience. No matter what time of day you’re exploring the pampas though, you’re going to need some serious bug cream.\n\nWhile you’ll get the opportunity to score sightings of all kinds of wildlife, from snakes, to monkeys, to capybaras, everyone agrees that taking a peek at the pink river dolphins is a highlight of any visit to the pampas. They’re extremely freaky and they look like aliens.", "Picking a good tour operator is imperative here. Spending a little more on a reputable, ecologically sound operation has short term consequences for you, and seriously long term consequences for the tourism industry and the environment of the Amazonian Basin. Be a responsible tourist and do your best to find a company with a solid track record.\n\nOne company with an excellent rating is Yuruma Journeys. This brand new tour operator strives to ensure a very delicate ecological footprint, and the accommodation they provide is a cut above most of the alternatives.", "Yes."]
