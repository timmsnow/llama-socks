Taking Uber can be a good way to get around and avoid walking long distances between buses in unfamiliar areas.", "Don’t wear jewelry, or carry an expensive camera around with you. It’s probably a good idea to leave the Safari camera in the hotel room, and bring a small point and click around the city with you.", "Downtown is actually safe to walk around during the day, but should probably be avoided at night. Hip places like Maboneng, while up and coming, still have a bit of grit to them, and it’s not unheard of for muggings to occur here during the day. If you do get mugged, give it all up immediately, and avoid eye contact with your assailant.", "You can’t plan for everything, so don’t let anxiety about crime ruin your time in Johannesburg. It’s entirely possible you won’t see anything go down. Use common sense and stick to well lit, populated areas and you should be fine."]

It’s pretty good bang for your rand, and breakfast is included in the booking. The grounds are comfortable and the common areas are a good place to unwind after a day walking around the city. It’s not the cheapest budget option out there, but it’s well located and the staff is helpful. Great base of operations for exploring Joburg.", "There is a lot to be said for this simple, straight-forward backpacker lodge located in Randburg. These guys have dorms, singles, and double rooms at affordable rates, and serve as a one stop shop for travelers who might not have access to their own transportation. The people at zoo lodge can arrange an airport shuttle, organize tours throughout South Africa, or set up smaller trips to local places like the Apartheid Museum. The lodge is also located in a safe area on Jan Smuts Ave near a public bus stop, making getting around a breeze for those interested in trying their hand at public transit. Simple, clean, and affordable, this place is a perfect starting point for independent minded travelers. See their website here."]

Looking out over the great expanse of the Indian Ocean you can almost feel the distance between the continents.\n\nDays here are spent lazing on tranquil beaches and watching animals graze around the small rondavel huts that dot the hillsides. Life here is a quiet, windswept, simple wonder, and spending a little time here watching the sun go down over an endless ocean vista gives you reason enough to question if maybe this is really how it was meant to be all along."

      "texts": ["It’s a long stretch of coastline, essentially starting from East London and running all the way east to Port St Johns. The direction you take to get to the coast depends on where exactly you’re trying to go. The whole stretch is made up of remote, poorly maintained roadways, and is little serviced by public transit. This means that without a doubt, your best option for getting around here is with your own wheels.\n\nDefinitely only drive around here during the day. It’s rural land, and there’s almost no lighting at night. The potholes here are deep and dangerous to drive through, not to mention the animals that roam freely from village to village. Give yourself a little extra time to go slowly, it’s pretty enough that you’ll want to take your time anyway.", "Without wheels you’re not totally out of luck, but you will need some time to get here with public transit. Mthatha is the main transit hub for the area, and most of your connections will be found here. There are occasional minibus taxi’s, but there is no set schedule and they typically leave when they are full, not when you’re ready to go.\n\nCoffee Bay makes for a good stop and it’s easy enough to grab a minivan in and out of the bay. Get an early start, as again, getting around in the dark is no easy feat here."]

If you’re looking for a peaceful place to relax and ignore the world for a few days (or more) it would be hard to make a wrong move here. That being said, there are a few places in particular that have notable attractions and are worth the effort involved in getting there.\n\nDon’t wander around on your own. If you aren’t hiking with a group, at least bring a friend. Places this remote can be dangerous when you’re alone. It’s a good idea to let your hotel know where you’re heading for the day as well.", "This is sort of the backpacker mainstay. It’s relatively easy to get to compared to a lot of the surrounding coast. The town itself feels a _little_ over run by the young tourist crowd, and if you stay at the Coffee Shack be prepared for the usual ruckus. The real benefit to coming here is that:\n\nA – there is a regular shuttle that picks up travelers from the Shell station 4km south of Mthatha. The Baz Bus regularly drops backpackers off there to make the connection, or alternatively you can get there on your own.\n\nB – The town itself is a great base for hiking around the area. It’s got well organized tourist infrastructure, and a lot of the familiar comforts backpackers are used to, like good coffee, wifi, etc. There are tour operators here that can get you just about anywhere you want to go on the Wild Coast. Just keep in mind the other tourists will be touring with you.\n\nA lot of people use this as a base to hike to the famous Hole in the Wall, which is about a 9 km hike from Coffee bay. It’s easy enough on your own without a guide but will take about 6 hours round trip, so bring a lunch and rain gear just in case.", "In terms of paradisiacal retreats, this one tops the charts. It’s really just a little organic farm-cum-guesthouse run by a european couple who are staunch advocates for simple living. There’s good food to be had here (as well as self catering available), a stocked bar with cold beer to accompany your sunset watching, and hammocks to laze the day away in. Lubanzi village is an adorable collection of rondavel huts peppered across rolling hills that end in dramatic clifftop views of a seemingly never-ending Indian Ocean. This is a place to recharge and relax. The friendly cows, sheep, pigs, and geese are included in the fun.", "The Sardine Run is literally straight out of a National Geographic video sequence. As well as Blue Planet, and every other nature documentary worth it’s salt. The phenomenon occurs every year, mostly in June and July, when conditions are just right for migrating sardines to gather in schools so massive as to lure big populations of their giant predators in for a meal. Whales, sharks, seals, and other friends all get together to have a feast for the ages. If you want to witness this once in a lifetime event, you’ll have to book a tour with one of the areas dive operators. This can be done from any of the major coastal towns, like Chintsa, Morgan Bay, and Port St Johns. Expect a wet, cold, long, and unforgettable day. You will basically be chasing the run throughout the day, and diving in when the time is right. Usually the experience lasts about 6-7 hours.", "This is about as far as you can go west before leaving the Wild Coast. You can feel civilization’s presence right around the corner. The good news is, for now, beautiful Chintsa beach is still an isolated paradise, ripe for relaxin’. It’s beautiful here. A little more tourist/backpackery than Coffee Bay, and with a similar demographic, but it’s easy enough to carve out a space for yourself away from others. It’s proximity to East London makes it an easy to reach Wild Coast destination."]
