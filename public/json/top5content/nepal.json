The ancient capital of Nepal has, for centuries been the gateway to the spiritual homeland of Buddhism, and to that most evocative of mountain ranges: the Himalayas. The city houses a plethora of both Hindu and Buddhist holy sites, and the sheer magnificence of the palaces and temples of central Durbar Square is enough to give any tourist traveling in the 21st century the chills.\n\nThese days, the modern metropolis is home to some 2.5 millions inhabitants and rising, and the frenetic atmosphere of the bustling city streets can, at times, feel anything but meditative. Colored prayer flags, dyed yak wool (yak socks!), and Tibetan prayer bowls hang in the windows of the shops in the mostly-pedestrianized tourist enclave of Thamel and everything from hiking poles to sub-zero sleeping bags can be supplied for upcoming trips into the Himalayas. While this can, at times, make the city feel more open-air mall than tranquil Shangri-la, if you spend a few days here exploring the cities winding alleyways and myriad holy sites, you’ll find yourself rewarded with an intimate view of a city who’s ancient heart beats in tandem with the towering landscape that surrounds it."]

While the views might not be of the up-close and personal-white-capped variety you can expect when flying into Lukla, or even Pokhara, you can definitely count on a memorable landing.", "Step off the plane onto the tarmac and enter the small red-brick building that serves as the international terminal. First up is visa selection. If you haven’t already secured your tourist visa, this is where you’ll do it. If you already have everything in order (visa application, passport photos, exact cash, etc), then the whole process will actually move pretty quickly for you.", "Once through the visa and immigration portion, you’ll be headed to baggage claim. Whether you’ve checked a bag or not, you’ll be putting all of your belongings through a security point when you head down the escalators. Then you’ll wait… generally for a goodly bit of time for your checked baggage to arrive. Once you have your bags you’ll be screened AGAIN when you go through customs. Count on at least an hour for the whole process to be concluded.", "If you’ve successfully navigated that minefield, you’ll be able to exit out to the main parking lot, where you’ll be greeted by hordes of taxi drivers clamoring to get your fare. This can involve a good deal of shouting, and often attempts to grab your luggage. They aren’t trying to rob you, just hoping that by carrying your bag you will accept them as your driver. If you aren’t accustomed to handling large crowds of eager taxi drivers, you may want to pre-book a hotel pick-up to save yourself some stress. You may be able to negotiate a lower price at the airport (NP 400-500), but then again, you may not. You will pay double for a pre-arranged car.", "You CAN take the public bus to the airport if you really want to. It’s about a 500 meter walk from the airport parking lot down the Main Street on the left hand side when you exit the gate.

It’s a bit of a walk from the center of town, or you can negotiate a taxi to get there (about 400 rupee).", "Visiting this stupa, located on the outskirts of town, was for me a highlight of my time in Kathmandu. The site was originally built as a stop along the long trade route that extended into Tibet and has actually become somewhat of a haven for Tibetan refugees, who have built their monasteries and convents surrounding the central stupa. The structure itself sits in the center of a circular plaza, surrounded by shops and rooftop restaurants which all make for a fantastic place to have a beer and take in the view. It would be easy to spend half a day here exploring the various temples in the area. **Note that on nights of the full moon there is a procession around the central stupa and thousands of devotees come to pray and light candles and lamps. If the timing is right, make sure you make yourself available for this unforgettable experience. You can technically take a bus here from an intersection near Ratna Park, however, note that navigating the local buses can be difficult and you may want to negotiate a taxi. It shouldn’t cost more than 500-600 rupees to get you there.", "A bit south of Kathmandu’s Durbar Square, is the equally impressive Patan Durbar Square. Once a separate city, Patan has slowly but surely been swallowed by the larger metropolitan growth of Kathmandu. Patan is one of the oldest Buddhist cities in the world and the Durbar Square holds the oldest Newari residences in all of Nepal. It’s a short taxi ride away from Thamel and well worth an afternoon visit.", "Outside of the major sites, there is a lot of fun to be had just walking around. Though the city itself is massive, the central core around Thamel is extremely walkable and relatively easy to navigate. Although the small alleyways can be somewhat labyrinthine, it’s difficult to get lost and stumbling onto the many, smaller temples that exist all around the city is what makes Kathmandu the gift that keeps on giving.", "On top of wandering, it’s easy to find yoga classes, meditation retreats, delicious Tibetan and Newari restaurants, and of course, limitless shopping opportunities.

Some people do a half-circuit, choosing to fly from Jomson back to Pokhara rather than climb down. The full circuit will take the average hiker 20-22 days and is a serious undertaking.\n\nThere are several options for where to start and end the trek, and it’s a good idea to have a go over all the options with your guide before you commit. Be realistic about your fitness level. Getting stuck because of exhaustion is not a good option."]

      "texts": ["For the shorter, lower-altitude hikes, like the 4 day Poon Hill trek, a guide really isn’t necessary unless you want the company. The trails are well sign posted, and heavily trafficked by other hikers, so you won’t be alone should anything happen. That being said, if you do decide to go it alone, make sure you pack light, because you’ll be gaining a lot of altitude and you can count on being exhausted at the end of every day.\n\nFor the longer, more challenging hikes, especially the ones heading to Muktinath and Jomson, it’s probably a good idea to have a guide with you. You won’t really know what the conditions will be like until you get up there, so it’s better to have someone with intimate knowledge of the trails. Accidents do happen, and people do die. Hiring a guide could go a long way to managing your expectations and preventing any problems.", "For all of the hikes going into the Annapurna Sanctuary there are two permits that will be required in order for you to begin your trek:\n\nThe TIMS (trekkers information management system) card and The Annapurna Conservation Area Permit (ACAP) can both be obtained from the tourist information center about 1.5 kilometers outside of Lakeside in Pokhara. Walk or take a tuk tuk to the info center and plan on spending about an hour here. The whole process is pretty self explanatory once you arrive at the info center.\n\nThe TIMS card costs NPR 2000 ($18 USD), while the ACAP will set you back NPR 3000 ($27 USD). Both are required in order to make it past the checkpoints along your hike. Make sure you bring your passport with you. You will need to fill out a few forms, and you’ll get your picture taken for the permits. SMILE!"]

      "texts": ["All along the mountain trails you’ll find little Nepalese “tea houses” offering up home-cooked meals, drinks, shade, and more often than not, a bed to crash in.", "There are small mountain towns that have a high density of these tea houses and most hikers will try to make it to a town before calling it a day, however even in-between the towns it’s common to find one or two of these tea houses peppered along the trail, offering up their services for the weary hiker.\n\nIf you get tired and need to cut out early, just remember there’s a tea house right around the corner just waiting to serve you some tea and a plate of momos. Mmmmmm momos.", "Most tea houses range in price from around $3-5 USD per night. Often you can make a deal with the owner by committing to eat a few meals instead of paying for your room. They’re pretty amenable in the mountains, so finding a cheap room is relatively easy.\n\nPrices DO go up the higher up the trail you go. This is because it gets harder and harder to get supplies and food to the tea house, and the transit costs get passed on to you. That’s just the nature of the game. Just be glad they got the beer all the way up there, amirite?!", "While the majority of tea houses offer pretty much the same standard of hotel experience (spoiler alert, it’s RUSTIC!), these rooms are first come first serve, so the earlier you arrive in town the more choice you’ll have in terms of views, and the quicker you’ll scope out the best seat next to the fireplace.", "Not every lodge will have working hot water heaters, so you may want to make that a priority when you’re making the rounds. Most of them will charge an additional fee to use it, but after a long day of trekking, when you’re cold, sore, and tired… it’s probably going to be the best $1.50 you ever spent."]
