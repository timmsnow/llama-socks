The park itself is ginormous, and serves as a year-round respite for animals looking for a little relief from southern Africa’s harsh desert climate. Chobe National Park stretches from the banks of the Zambezi in the far north of Botswana, down to the edge of the Okavango Delta, where Moremi Game Reserve begins. Together with its neighboring game reserves, Chobe serves as one of the largest natural animal sanctuaries in the world, and the wildlife, particularly those thirsty elephants, come in droves.\n\nJust north of the park lies the great Zambezi river, the feeder river for the Chobe, the river after which the park is named. It’s here along the waterfront of the Chobe river that herds of elephants gather year round to drink, bathe, play, and socialize. The borders of 4 countries (Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe) also converge on the Zambezi, making this area something of a weigh-station for travelers venturing onward to other parts of Africa, particularly those headed to see the “smoke that thunders” aka, Victoria Falls."]

To get here you have either crossed the Zambezi from Zambia or Namibia, or you have made your way up the sealed A 33 road that leads north-ward from the town of Nata, along the eastern edge of Botswana.\n\nKasane is the major tourist outpost in this corner of the country, and it is the last reliable place to fill up on gas, groceries, and firewood before making your way into the park. Tons of tours and lodges operate in the Kasane area, so if you’re planning on making day trips rather than traversing the length of the park, it’s likely that this is where you’ll be staying. From Kasane you can either stick to the sealed road, or you can hug the Chobe waterfront and meander along the Chobe River. Both options will lead you to the gate, but note that the waterfront, though more animal-saturated, takes a good bit more time to navigate, and may be more difficult during the wetter months of November-April.","If you are approaching Chobe from the south, your likely starting point will be the city of Maun. It’s a BUSY place, and something of a tourist mecca here, so stocking up on all the essentials is easy, though maybe a little unpleasant. Heading north from Maun you’ll drive on a bumpy gravel road, stopping to pass through a few small villages as well as a vet fence (foot and mouth disease control fence). Eventually you’ll arrive at the Mababe Gate, and from here it’s onward north along the Mababe depression to get to access the park.\n\nNote that there are a couple of different routes you can take through the park, some of which can be hazardous depending on the time of year and conditions of the road. Avoid taking the marsh road during wet season as it’s not a question of IF, but rather WHEN you will get stuck. There have been reports of 4x4s bogged down along the marsh road for days at a time with little hope of extrication. Don’t be that guy. The sand-ridge road is unsurprisingly sandy, but relatively easy to navigate even in high 4. Always ask at the gate for the best route to take before making your journey."]

You can expect to see huge herds of elephant families here in some of the highest numbers in all of Africa.\n\nThe **Ngwezumba Pans** are a collection of large clay pans that sit about 70 kms south of the Chobe river. This area is less inundated with animals, however it’s a beautiful section of the park, and quite unique for the area.\n\nThe **Savuti** section of the park is perhaps the most famous area in Chobe as it’s considered one of the best wildlife viewing areas on the entire African continent. Savuti is particularly famous for its large lion population, which has developed the unusual skill of taking down giant elephants to feed their voracious appetites. It’s a profoundly beautiful section of the park, however it’s popular so you won’t be finding yourself alone here.\n\nThe **Linyati** area lies in the western portion of the park as it heads toward the Okavango Delta. It’s fantastic for wildlife viewing, and has a terrain similar to that of the delta itself. Beautiful, for sure, but note that the area can be prone to flooding, so it’s a good idea to do a little research before making your way to this corner of the park.","Entrance to the National Park is to be paid daily. This means if you’re spending the night you will need to pay park fees for BOTH days. If you’re only here on a day trip, try to come as early as possible to get the most out of your entrance fee. If you are staying at a lodge within the boundaries of the park, you are responsible for paying the park entry for your entire stay.\n\nLike most national parks in Botswana, the opening hours are 6 am-6:30 PM during the dry season (April-September), and 5:30 am-7 pm the rest of the year. (Think, daylight hours)\n\nThe daily park entrance fees are 120 pula (approx USD $12) per person, and 50 pula (USD $5) per vehicle. Entrance costs are priced per day.","Driving in Chobe can be tricky at times, especially during the wetter months when some roads become impassable. A 4×4 is ABSOLUTELY needed to enter this park. The majority of the roads are covered in DEEP sand, and some portions of it can get tricky even in low gear, especially in the dry season when the sand is not as compacted. Always follow the tracks when driving in deep sand, maintain your momentum, and definitely let some air out of your tires before attempting this drive. There are long stretches in the park with little to no shade, so deflating tires can be a real pain if you get stuck in the hot sun.\n\nDo NOT drive on the marsh road in the wet season. You WILL get stuck. It will be embarrassing, and everyone will laugh at you… if they find you. Mud is a fact of life in this park. Make sure you have a plan for getting yourself unstuck. Winches, hijacks, and shovels can all prove essential when dealing with a muddy road. Give yourself plenty of time for the unforeseen in your daily itinerary.\n\nCertain areas of the park are more prone to flooding than others. The river front and Linyati can both be treacherous during the wet season, so always check with the park rangers for up to date information when you’re entering the park.","Carry a “Tracks 4 Africa” paper map with you at all times. Do not rely on GPS as it’s a crapshoot in this park, and often gives you out of date or just plain inaccurate information. In addition, it could be a good idea to purchase a Chobe specific map, especially if you are spending several days and visiting different areas within the park. You can find them in Kasane, or at most of the parks entrance gates."]

Most campsites here have excellent facilities, with elephant proofing around the ablution blocks, however it can still be a good idea to limit your night-time movements. Try to get everything done during the day, and stay next to your unlocked car at night in case you need to make a run for it.\n\nLions, elephants, hyenas, and everybody else may be interested in checking out what you’ve got going on, so make sure all your food is put away properly, and stay vigilant when you’re outside of your tent after dark.","Bring snacks with you when you leave in the morning so you don’t have to go all the way back to your lodge/campground.

You’ll see animals in transit between the watering holes as well, but as a general rule you can count on finding most of them bathing and drinking it up, especially in the dry season when water becomes a hot commodity.\n\nThe area known as the Mababe despression, towards the southern portion of the park is a fantastic open savannah that makes for excellent animal viewing. Elephants, zebras, giraffes, and cheetahs are here by the plenty, and the low grass makes them easier to spot than in other areas of the park.

It’s a hard place to live, and only the hardiest of the animal kingdom can make it work here. For those willing to carve a life out of the unforgiving terrain, the reward is a vast territory and lots of spread-out room, and in times of plenty life can be grand. But those times are few and far between and the majority of life in the Kalahari is an exercise of desperation, with only the strongest of the strong having a remote chance at survival.\n\nThe park itself is the size of Denmark, and spending time in the park means crossing vast, empty areas devoid of human life. Coming to the Kalahari means a good deal of time spent on your own, and you can not expect to get any food or supplies once you’ve crossed the entry gate. What you bring in is what you have. While it can be a daunting experience to venture so far off the beaten track, it may also be one of the most rewarding.

      "texts": ["The most important element for any trip into the desert is the car you’ll be driving. A 4×4 is an absolute MUST here. You can pretty much count on driving in deep sand, mud, water, and high grass. You car has to be able to handle all that the Kalahari throws at it. It’s a good idea to get a fully equipped 4×4 from one of the many notable rental agencies operating in Botswana and South Africa. Bushlore is a good place to start. Renting a 4×4 with tents on the roof can give you a sense of security when camping in the desert. Animals are less likely to come sniffing around your tent if it’s elevated.","Your 4×4 vehicle should have a double-sized gas tank, outfitted for covering long distances. Most double tank vehicles will hold around 150 liters of diesel or gasoline, allowing for somewhere in the ballpark of 1000 kilometers of travel per full tank. This is not an exact science however, since driving in sand and other off-road conditions will guzzle more gas than regular highway driving. It’s smart to bring a couple extra jerry cans of petrol JUST in case to allow for more flexibility once you’re in the park.","If you are planning to cross the Kalahari you should budget at least 4 days/3 nights or more depending on the route you’re planning to take. Depending on the time of year, weather conditions, and the route, you may want to consider traveling in a caravan with at least one other vehicle. If you happen to encounter some nasty mud, or are unable to extricate your vehicle from a bad situation, you may need help from another car. Because of the size and remote location, finding help from a stranger in the desert is extremely unlikely.\n\nHaving a proper map is extremely helpful. Get an up to date copy of Tracks 4 Africa, Botswana, and pair it with the Tracks 4 Africa GPS system. Most rental agencies will be able to provide you with a working GPS at little or no additional cost. HOWEVER, the GPS is NOT the bible here. Often roads that have been recorded in the GPS software are no longer operating or can be misleading. Go over your desired route with the park officials at the entry gate and make sure your route details make sense and that it’s a viable plan. The park officials have the most up to date road information and can be vital in making your final route plan.","Coming to the Kalahari during dry season means you will be experiencing deep, loose sand driving for the majority of your time in the park. The wet season can bring heavy rains, which compacts the sand and makes it easier to navigate, but can also muddy up portions of the road making it messy and difficult to get around. Getting stuck in deep mud can be a real concern during the wet season, so make sure your vehicle comes with a hi-jack, winches, and a shovel so you can dig yourself out if you get stuck.","Bringing enough food and water is essential. Most rental agencies will provide a working fridge with enough space to store 4-5 days worth of food. In addition, bring some emergency foods that don’t require refrigeration, enough to last you in the event you get stranded. Stocking the vehicle with fresh drinking water is imperative. Bring between 5-8 liters of drinking water per person, per day. This may seem overkill, and you might not be happy about how much space the water takes up, but believe me it goes quicker than you realize, especially with the heat of the desert sun baring down on your back."]

That being said there are several distinct areas of interest that should be considered when planning your route through the park.","Deception Valley may be the most famous area of the CKGR. It’s about an hours drive from the Matswere Gate, in the north eastern portion of the park, making it an easy and accessible area to visit. For those not interested in crossing the desert, this is a good pocket of the park to explore on shorter itineraries.\n\nDeception Valley is famous for the predators (cheetahs, leopards, lions) who tend to hang around the area. It’s an easy part of the park to explore with great flat expanses and open savannas perfect for game viewing from a distance. The campsites at Kori (see recommended sleeps below) are phenomenally located just a short distance from the valley and serve as a great launch point for area game drives. You may want to spend a couple nights in the area to increase your chances of predator spotting.","The Passarge Valley in the far north of the park is a lovely stretch of isolated desert where few people tend to go. Your chances of seeing an abundance of wildlife up here are about as high as your chances of running into other people are low. It’s an extremely beautiful area of the park, that ranges from dense scrubland to wide open areas with the occasional watering hole. Lions, springbok, oryx, bat-eared foxes, and giraffe are common sightings here. The Passarge Valley campsite #2 was one of our favorite campsites in all of Botswana.","As you head south and west through the park you will encounter an area known as the western pans, with Piper Pan being especially notable. This is an area unique in the CKGR. It’s essentially a series of vast, wide open, short-grass pans that make for good game viewing. The area is known for lions, kudus, oryx, cheetahs and wildebeest. While it’s likely you’ll only stop here if you’re making the long trek from Matswere to Xade gate (or vice versa), stopping to spend one night here will more than likely give you an isolated and personal experience of the desert, and make for some fond memories of your time here.","While technically not part of the CKGR, this little corner of the Kalahari in the far south is essentially connected to the CKGR without being integrated. The boundaries of Khutse are small and manageable as a day trip, which makes it one of the most accessible areas of the park. All of the best of the CKGR can be seen here, and sightings of lions, cheetahs, and kudus can be expected. If you’re looking for a little sampling of the Kalahari experience without committing to the long distance driving, Khutse could be for you.",""]

Predators are mostly nocturnal, and because the Kalahari is a particularly rough environment, this might not be the place you want to make yourself available to them. Building a fire and eating your dinner while it’s still light out is a smart way to go. Make sure your camp is completely set up by sun down, and leave your car unlocked so its ready should you need to make an emergency run for it (it’s unlikely, but just… ya know, in case). Build your campsite with your car behind you and the fire in front, to create a natural barrier against any sneak attacks. While this is extremely uncommon, it’s still smart to be careful. Enjoy your time by the fire, there’s no need to rush, but always stay vigilant if you’re out of the tent after nightfall.","Game driving in the Kalahari means getting up early. The earlier you get started the more success you’ll have with animal sightings. The truth is IT’S REALLY INSANELY HOT here during the day. Once the sun gets up overhead, the vast majority of the activity stops and animals retreat to whatever patch of shade they can muster until around 5pm when things start to cool off. While it’s true that you may come across a lion or two lazing in the shade near the road, the chances are you’re probably missing 99% of the wildlife that CAN’T be seen from the road. Wake up, pound some coffee, get an early start. Make the most of the mornings here. You can eat breakfast after the drive, and you can sleep when you’re dead.","Book all campsites in advance. In order to self-drive in the Kalahari you must have camp site reservations. The majority of the camp sites are no longer government run so bookings for most of the sites can not be made last minute at the gate. You will need to reserve each site for each night in advance. Make sure you are planning a realistic route and give yourself enough time to make it from one campsite to the next each day. Given that you’ll be traveling at speeds between 20-40 kmph, it’s a good idea to be conservative when planning out your daily distances.","Traveling into the deepest corner of the desert means you are more than likely COMPLETELY ON YOUR OWN. It’s highly probable that you will go a long time without coming across another individual. This means you have to look out for yourself. Be careful when exiting the vehicle and walking around your campsite, especially at night. Animals of all kinds are around, some of which are predatory. Snakes, spiders, and scorpions should be a real concern. Never walk around at night without a light. Don’t wear open toed shoes and keep an eye on where you’re stepping. Shake out any shoes left outside of the tent.\n\nBring a satellite phone for emergencies and make sure you know how to use it. It’s not a bad idea to get the phone numbers where the park officials at the entrance gates can be reached in case of a real emergency."]

Gweta lodge is comfortable, but simple lodge accommodation and it won’t cost you a fortune to stay here. You can book a private chalet, family room, or even set up a tent on their secure grounds. Self catering is possible with the use of their braii pits, but don’t expect too much in the way of ambience. Gweta lodge also runs tours to the nearby Ntwetwe Pan to visit the meerkats, however, this is only possible during the dry season. Visit their website here for more information."]

      "texts": "The Okavango is one of the world’s largest inland deltas, and one of the most unique and intoxicating places on the planet. What is essentially a vast network of flood channels, with waters that rise and fall seasonally with the influx of excessive rain fall from Angola, the Okavango is a corner of Botswana that is in a perpetual state of change. What would otherwise be a continuation of the barren, dusty Kalahari desert, gets transformed into a lush, watery eden, a life-giving oasis for a thirsty and dependent animal population. \n\nThis means animal life thrives in the delta, creating one of the highest-density habitats on the entire African continent. Thanks to the flooding, the inaccessibility of the delta to man has created a natural line of defense. Here animals are safe-guarded from the usual encroachment. Poaching here is almost non-existent, and clashes over habitat and food are a non-issue.\n\nExperiencing the Okavango is a thrilling once in a lifetime experience and coming here is not something that should be taken lightly. Because it’s such a unique and beautiful place, planning your time here is essential. Spending a few days navigating this watery wonderland can mean taking a big chunk out of your Botswana budget. It’s important to figure out which area of the park is right for you, and which is the best way to get the most out of your time spent here. Keep in mind that there are some activities that can ONLY be experienced in the delta. Prioritize the things that make the delta itself a special experience, and go down the list from there."

      "texts": ["The Okavango Delta is really divided into four specific regions. The Panhandle, the Eastern Delta, the Inner Delta, and the Moremi Game Reserve.", "The “Panhandle” refers to the western portion of the delta area, where the water from Angola gathers as it enters Botswana, creating a year round marine environment and the headwater source of the flooding which fills the delta seasonally. The panhandle runs parallel to the A3 highway, and there are a number of lower-cost and midrange accommodation options here. This is a great access point for the delta, especially for those who are short on time or trying to navigate the area without buying a high-cost tour. A lot of what the Okavango offers can be accomplished from here, although the high-density animal activity really picks up the deeper into the delta you go.\n\nFor birders, anglers, and those who like spending time on the open water, the panhandle is paradise."
      ,"The area of the delta itself includes the Eastern Delta, Moremi Game Reserve, and the inner delta. While both Moremi and the Eastern delta are accessible via road (in a 4×4), much of the inner delta is completely cut off from the world by water. Visiting the inner delta means arranging private flights with expensive safari lodges. While the experience is unforgettable, and no-doubt packed with high density animal encounters, you can bet that your bank account won’t be nearly as excited. This is the part of the Okavango that people talk about when talking about Botswana’s high ticket price.\n\nThe Eastern Delta is a little more accessible, and therefore parts of it can be visited independently. Camp grounds do exist here, although they are some of the more expensive sites in Botswana, and aren’t always easy to get to. You do need to be careful when attempting to reach the Eastern Delta (and parts of Moremi) as roads can flood seasonally and portions of the park may become off-limits. Always discuss your options with local park rangers before plowing ahead. This is an area where it’s not the worst idea to let someone else take the reins, even if it’s more expensive."]

      "texts": ["Probably the number one activity for people spending any time in the delta is a mokoro trip. The mokoro is a traditional dugout style canoe, usually big enough to hold two passengers and a poler. Because of the changing nature of the delta (shallow water, excessive plant life), the majority of the channels can not be visited with a motorized boat, and can only be successfully navigated by using a pole to push the mokoro forward. These small, traditional boats sit very low to the water, so passengers are at eye level with the surrounding vegetation and wildlife of the delta. You can expect a seriously UP CLOSE experience. Elephants, hippos, crocodiles, and tons of exotic birdlife inhabit the channels, and they’ll all be eager to see what you’re all about.\n\nDay trips as well as multi-day, overnight camping trips can be organized through nearly every lodge in the Okavango area, but a great place to start would be the Okavango Poler’s Trust (phone: +267 6876861) in the panhandle region. Because this trust is run directly by local people the cost is significantly less than booking through a lodge or tour operator, however you will need to provide your own food and camping supplies if staying overnight.", "Flights over the delta are a great way to get the full picture and scale of this geological wonder. It’s said that the Okavango Delta can be seen from space, but taking a flight is probably the closest you’re ever going to get. These scenic flights normally last between 45 minutes to one hour and the cost varies but hovers around the 2900-3500 pula (USD $280-330) range per PLANE. This means the per person rate can go down depending on how many people you can convince to join your flight. Most planes are 3 or 5 seaters. A couple companies worth checking out are:  Mack Air, Kavango Air, and Air Botswana.\n\nIt’s a good idea to book your flight at least a day or two in advance. The majority of the flights operate out of Maun International Airport.","Birders are everywhere in the Delta, and bird-watching is a past-time that might sound a little boring initially, but can actually become a good bit of fun and mildly addictive. There are tons of migrating bird species that move through the delta, and some resident species that can only be found here. Taking a boat out onto the water with a knowledgable guide and a good pair of binoculars is a surprisingly cathartic and enjoyable experience, and one wholly unique to this corner of Africa.","The Moremi Game Reserve is perhaps the highlight for many people traveling through Botswana. This national park is extremely high-density, and can provide you with some of the most breath-taking and exciting animal encounters on the whole continent. This is mostly true during the dry season, when the delta has reached its high water mark and the whole area is flooded. Animals come here in droves, and many get stuck in high density pockets like Chief’s Island, unable to migrate anywhere else until the waters recede. During the wet season the animals can be a bit more dispersed, however there is great game viewing to be had in Moremi year round.\n\nSome of Moremi can be difficult to navigate on your own, and it can be a good idea to take a guide if you’re planning to visit, especially during wet season. The Moremi Tongue portion of the park is generally easier to access than Chief’s Island."]

      "texts": "Located in the north western corner of Botswana, the Tsodilo Hills rise up, seemingly out of nowhere, from the flat, barren Kalahari as sparkling quartzite pyramids. These beautiful, shimmering masses stand clustered together amid an otherwise featureless landscape. The hills represent a sacred space for the people of the Kalahari. For over 100,000 years, this place has housed, fed, and given resources to the people of the desert, and their long archeological record is one of the strongest links to human history in existence today. \nWith over 4,500 rock art paintings, dating from the earliest days of the stone age all the way up to the 18th century, the Tsodilo Hills provide a consistent record of mans civilizational evolution. The sheer volume of archeologic findings, along with specific geological conditions have created a timeline of mans relationship to the natural world, and provide a clear record of the many changes that early humans experienced over the last hundred millenia. It’s not surprising that the Tsodilo Hills are considered a sacred area to the locals who live there. The other worldly vibration that can be felt in the hills is a palpable echo of a time long past, and one of the few places on Earth where we can find such a close connection to our collective history as a species."

There are several turn offs for the hills marked on most paper maps and GPS systems seem to like to instruct you to turn onto poorly marked side roads, however it’s best to stick to the main road and follow the road signs that indicate the proper turn. There is a large official sign at the correct turn off, and this is the road that should be taken.", "Note that the A35 highway, though paved, is extremely pot-holed, and it isn’t a good idea to go much faster than 80 kmph while driving on it as large, unavoidable potholes can show up out of nowhere. Additionally, you’ll find this corner of Botswana to be particularly live-stock filled, with goats, donkeys, and cows constantly populating the limited space on the highway. Be vigilant.","The gravel road that leads to the Tsodilo Hills from the turn off is not a particularly fun road to drive on. It can get bumpy so it’s smart to go slower than 80 kmph and definitely lower your tire pressure to around 200 bar. During the rainy season large, deep puddles can form on the road here. Some of them can be avoided by alternate paths that weave off-road, but be prepared to employ your water crossing protocol here.","From here you will be greeted by a guide, and they will explain the layout of the park, and give you options on which hike you’d like to take. The guide is compulsory, and every party MUST have a guide to visit the hills. The cost for a guided hike is 120 pula total, per guided tour, NOT per person, although throwing in a tip is not a bad look, especially if you’re embarking on a mid-day tour. It can get really, really hot out there.","The Hills are open to the public from sunrise to sunset, with tours lasting between 2-4 hours depending on which route you’d like to embark on. The site is best visited in the morning or in the late afternoon because it IS BLOODY HOT!"]

      "texts": ["Apart from the fact that tourists walking around in important archeological sites obviously require supervision, another good reason for the compulsory guide is safety. Walking these trails involves a bit of tall grass, and the area is known to be home to numerous species of poisonous snakes, leopards, and a number of other predatory and dangerous fauna. Watch where you’re stepping, stay on the trail, and follow the guide.","The Rhino Trail is by far the most popular trail and for good reason. It’s the shortest of all the routes (approximately 2 hour loop), which is helpful especially if you’re hiking in the middle of the day. There is NO shade, and the climb can be exhausting. The Rhino Trail also gives you what is perhaps the most varied and interesting selection of the rock paintings in the area. With paintings dating from the stone age through modern times, and depicting everything from animal life to religious ceremony, it’s perhaps provides the best cross-section of all the hills, so if you’re short on time, this may be the trail for you. Paintings of rhinos, whales, and the famous “dancing penises” can all be viewed from this trail.","The cliff trail is a bit more arduous of a climb, and starts a little north of female hill. Parts of the trail have some similarities to the Rhino Trail, but many of the rock paintings are harder to see, further from the path, or obstructed by the surrounding environment. There is an interesting cave that was most likely the site of some ancient rituals, and beautiful views of the surrounding desert are the reward for the effort involved. The Cliff Trail will take about 3 hours to complete.","The Lion Trail does not involve any climbing up the actual hills, so is a good option for anyone who is out of shape or might struggle with a hike. Parts of the Lion Trail converge with the Rhino Trail, so there is still plenty to be seen without the arduous climb to the top, however the great majority of the paintings on the Rhino trail would be missed.","The Male Hill is generally considered to be the most difficult of all the hikes, and will take you to the very top of the “Male Hill”. The views from the top are a reward in and of themselves, although I wouldn’t recommend attempting the climb any time other than early in the morning or late in the afternoon. This trail eventually links up with the Lion Trail, so you will still get some impressive views of the rock art. This is one of the longer trails, so you’ll want to budget 3-4 hours for the trip."]
