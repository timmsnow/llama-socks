Cancelations are common and frustrations abound, that being said, you know the rate you are paying is fair. The official white taxis in Cairo are metered and you should be able to hail one easily, especially near the square. You may meet a little resistance about the meter, but most drivers will relent if you make moves to abandon the trip. The trip length depends on the traffic, but most experienced drivers will take the ring road rather than going through Giza itself, which should save on time.

Egyptians have been sailing these waters for millennia using simple boats that simply float. These little wonders are at the mercy of the winds, so trip length depends heavily on a steady airflow. Because the Nile flows north, these trips are generally organized from the south of the country, to follow the current. You will get there eventually, with or without the wind. But the wind certainly helps.", "The best place to get started on a Felucca trip is in Aswan. You can’t be in Aswan for more than a day without meeting at least one, if not many, boat captains with a trip down the Nile on offer. Spoiler alert: they tend to hang out by the river, near the boats… If you walk down the promenade, you’ll meet all of them, and then you’ll meet them again when you walk back.\n\nIt’s good to take a couple days and familiarize yourself with your options. After talking to a few different captains you will be able to sort out which boat trip will be the best for you, based on price, what’s included, and most importantly, the vibe of your felucca captain. It’s good to have a couple people in your group to get a better deal, besides a sailing trip for one is… meh. The felucca’s are not large crafts, so a group of 2-4 people is probably a comfortable number.\n\nAfter a few days in Aswan, once you’ve explored this lower-kingdom mainstay, with its Abu Simbels and its Philae islands and whatnot you should be about ready to get on that boat!", "Sailing trips of varying lengths are on offer here. Short afternoon sails can be arranged for 1-3 hours for those not wanting the full overnight, sleep-on-the-boat experience. If you just want a taste, this can be a great way to get a new perspective on the Aswan area.\n\nA 2 day, 1 night trip will get you from Aswan to Kom Ombo, a small village north of Aswan with an impressive temple dedicated to the crocodile god. Your felucca captain will drop you right at the entrance for the temple, where you will most likely be the only person aside from the sleepy ticket taker.\n\n3 days, 2 nights will get you to Edfu temple. You can still stop at Kom Ombo to check it out, then continue northwards for another day of lazing on the deck and sleeping under the stars.\n\nThe ultimate felucca ride would be the 5 day, 4 night option. This ride will take you all the way to Luxor. Again, you can make stops at Kom Ombo and Edfu if you like. This is definitely for the hardier stock. Now, I love a good felucca ride, and taking a dip in the Nile is refreshing and all, but personally, come day 3 I’m ready for a shower and a cold beer (that cooler ice ain’t gonna last 5 days). If you have the time, and you just LOVE river sailing, go for it. I won’t tell you not to. Just keep in mind, feluccas don’t have bathroom facilities, so, just remember that I told you so when you’re halfway to Edfu and wishing you’d only paid for the 2 night trip.", "This is highly variable. So many factors contribute to what you’re going to pay here. This is Egypt, so literally NOTHING is a set price. It will highly depend on the time of year you are traveling. Low season prices are a fraction of what you spend in high season. The number of people on the felucca can also make a difference in price. You have to make it worth a mans time to spend 2-5 days on a boat with, and feign interest in, a foreigner who doesn’t speak his language. Obviously the higher the number of people going, the lower the cost per person. Shop around to get an idea of the price range. A little light haggling should get you to a price you are both happy with.", "All of your meals should be included for the time you are on the felucca. If the wind doesn’t cooperate and you have to end your trip short of your destination, there should be a transfer in a van included that can take you all the way to your final destination. Make sure this is discussed beforehand as low winds can be a common occurrence. While this is not about the destination so much as the experience, I’m guessing you would prefer to be dropped off in a town as opposed to the side of the river… somewhere."]

Basically, once the dam was built and the lake was formed the Nile become split into two sections, the one without crocodiles (everything north of the dam), and the one WITH crocodiles (the lake and everything south of it). So even if it’s really hot (it will be), don’t even think about taking a dip. Those crocs love that lake.", "If you decide to spend the night in Abu Simbel you will be able to spend more time at the temple, with the added bonus of A- watching the sunrise over the temple, which sounds lovely, and B- getting to sneak in during that short window of time during the day when there’s nary a soul about. The cruise ships will be showing up right as the temple opens, but they generally leave within an hour or so. The others coming in on the 4am convoy won’t arrive until atleast 7, if not later, so if you time it right, you may get to explore the temple with almost no one around. Is that worth a night stay in Abu Simbel? I dunno…  Also, if you go in the shoulder/off-season and you give yourself enough time, you’ll find there are lulls throughout the day. But it’s a bit of a crapshoot in terms of crowd level."]
