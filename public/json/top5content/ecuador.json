Prices can be a little higher at night depending on how far you’re trying to go.\n\nBRING A BIKE\n\nBecause all of the taxi’s are flat bed trucks, it’s easy to throw a bicycle in the back. This is especially good if you happen to get a flat tire. Having a bicycle for short distances and using the taxis for long distances will go a long way to keeping your budget under control and give you the most access to the interior of the island.\n\nIF GOING DEEP, PRE-ARRANGE YOUR RIDE\n\nKeep in mind you may need to arrange your pickup in advance if you are going somewhere remote.

The beaches here aren’t known for their white sand, or carribean-clear water. There’s little in the way of resort-culture. There are of course the ongoing infrastructure problems, and Ecuador’s unique weather system creates conditions in which the dry season (Ecuadors busy tourist season) tends to be cold on the coast, and the wet season, when less people enter the country, happens to be the most rewarding time to visit.\n\nWhile Ecuadors coast may not have the Caribbean beaches of Colombia, or the glamour of Brasil or even Uruguay, itsfriendly villages, epic sunsets, and complete lack of crowds make it a fantastic place to explore.

There’s enough going on here to keep you busy, but the beach remains uncrowded and delightful. You can organize a trip to Isla del Plata to see the Blue Footed Boobies, but if you’re already going to Galapagos, I wouldn’t blame you for skipping it.", "A short hike through Machililia National Park from the highway, where the local bus drops you off, lies the unquestionably beautiful Los Frailes Beach. This is by far the most stunning beach on the coast and it would be a shame for you to miss it. It IS popular, but it’s big enough that you’ll find plenty of empty space to lay your towel. You can either take a tuk tuk from the highway straight to the entrance, or you can hike through the desert landscape and take in the cliff-top views for about an hour to reach the beach. The path after the park checkpoin is clearly marked."]

Though similar in price to most of the other budget accommodation, Hotel Amalur is newer and cleaner than the majority of the competition. The rooms are immaculate and comfortable and there is an abundance of social spaces including a garden courtyard as well as a rooftop terrace. The downstairs restaurant is one of the best in town and the staff is exceedingly friendly. It’s a top pick in Canoa for the price.", "A collection of Bungalows more than a hotel, this beachfront rental is on the quieter side of town at the far end of the beach. It’s about a 10 minute walk from the center, but far enough away that you won’t be bothered by the noise coming from the beach bars. The quality of the cabins is on par with other, more expensive Hosteria’s in the area, but the price is cheaper. The hammocks in the back garden make for a perfect place to relax with a book."]

      "texts": "The city of Guayaquil is situated in the south west region of the country and for years has served as Ecuadors largest, and one of South America’s biggest and busiest ports on the Pacific. Guayaquil is Ecuadors largest city by population, and like most port towns, there is a somewhat frenetic energy running through the place.\n\nFor years Guayaquil has had a bit of a reputation for being seedy, and not a very friendly or safe place to visit. Most people who visited were just passing through on their way to the Galapagos. These days though, things are changing and Guayaquil is becoming a destination in its own right. There’s a vibrancy here that’s truly and uniquely Ecuadorian, not to mention this place is home to some of the best seafood in the country. To miss Guayaquil is to deprive yourself of a true gem of the coast."

It’s also a pretty modern airport, and the immigration/customs process moves quickly and efficiently. No complaints here.\n\nGetting a taxi from the airport is easy, though the cost will depend on which part of town you’re in and what time of day you’re arriving. Count on $5 to the city center during the day ($1 per kilometer approximately).\n\nIf you’re heading back to Guayaquil from the Galapagos, this could be the saddest day of your life.", "The brand new international bus terminal is conveniently located across the street from the airport. If you are only landing in Guayaquil to head somewhere else, you’re in luck, it’s a 5 minute walk to the bus station. There’s a mall on the first floor if you need to stock up on a few things before you go.\n\nIf you’re arriving in Guayaquil and want to grab a local bus into the city center you can walk across the street to Rio Daule terminal and grab the Metrovia (rapid transit bus) from here. All of the bus stops are coded individually, and you will want to make sure that the code for your bus stop is included in the route of the bus you’re taking. All of the bus stops have full route maps for this purpose so it shouldn’t be too hard to work out.\n\nYou have to purchase an electronic card in order to ride the Metrovia, so you should think about how often you’re going to be riding the bus while you’re in Guayaquil before deciding if it’s worth it or not."]

This promenade runs parallel to the sea and is chock full of shops, restaurants, entertainment etc etc etc. The Malecon is the best place for an evening stroll and the gigantic clear-pod Ferris wheel is a hell of a place to watch the sunset. Seriously, you’ll get some crazy good views of the city as well as the Pacific Ocean. This used to be considered a pretty dodgy area, but there has been a massive effort to clean up the area and as a result there are a good number of security guards walking around the fenced in portions of the Malecon, so you shouldn’t have any problems as long as you stick to the main drag.", "Guayaquil’s crowning glory, the neighborhood of Las Peñas sits atop the Santa Ana Hills that rise up from the streets below at the northern end of the Malecon. This is Guayaquil’s Historic district, and the majority of it’s colonial architectural history is on display here. The buildings are colorful and extremely photogenic, and the views of the city are worth the long walk up the 400 or so steps needed to reach the top of the mountain.", "The area surrounding this large plaza is best visited during the day as it’s known to be a little less friendly at night. The park itself is a pretty little oasis from the hubbub of the big city, and there are TONS of giant iguana’s running about the park just dying to make new friends. It’s a busy place during the day, but a great way to spend some time in the afternoon."]
