Technically, Penang is broken into two parts: the island itself, and the small strip along the mainland coast known as Seberang Perai, which connects the district to the rest of the country. George Town is the state’s UNESCO world heritage site capital, and what most people think of when talking about Penang, while across the water on the mainland, Butterworth is the satellite city through which George Town is connected to the rest of the country via highway and train.\n\nAlthough Penang has an incredibly rich history and played a hugely important role in the administration of the SE Asian British Empire, today it’s the preservation of the 19th century architecture, which survived WW2 mostly unscathed, that draws most visitors to the state. Penang is also considered to be Malaysia’s food capital, with food stalls and street markets offering culinary delights as varied and complex as the cultural makeup of the region itself. Eating in Penang is one of the great joys of visiting, and you should ready your stomach for some marathon dining. Seriously, it’s all delicious, and it’s simply what you do here.\n\nThe only down-side to visiting Penang is that it can be difficult to pull yourself away from it.

To say Semporna is likely to be the least pleasant part of your journey is putting it mildly at best. The city itself is chaotic, horribly polluted, extremely stinky, and overpriced considering the lack of quality accommodation. There are very few upsides to staying in Semporna, although there is a tourist-promenade with some excellent (if over-priced) seafood restaurants, and some decent happy hours. My recommendation is to have a plan on arrival and get out as quickly as you came in. If you haven’t arranged your Sipidan permits in advance, you could end up being stuck in Semporna for DAYS, which to me sounds a little like the third level of hell, except stinkier.\n\n* Note that Semporna has the only ATM around, and as a result it’s often out of cash. Plan ahead and try not to rely on it unless absolutely necessary.","Semporna is about an hours drive from the nearest airport (it’s near Tawau). If you are visiting with limited time, this can be a good option for you however note that the public bus connecting the Tawau airport to Semporna takes awhile. You will need to pre-book a transfer with your hotel OR you can arrange a minivan shuttle at the Tawau airport upon arrival. The minivan option is much cheaper (at around 10RM) and takes approximately 1-1.5 hours. If you are hoping to depart via the Tawau airport however, you may end up waiting at the Semporna bus station for awhile for it to get full before it departs, so give yourself a wide buffer… or arrange a transfer with your dive shop.", "There are buses from Kota Kinabalu and Sandakan that take about 9 hours and 5-6 hours respectively. You can expect all the joy that comes from riding a public bus in Borneo… bring snacks and don’t drink too many liquids before boarding as stops are infrequent."]

      "texts": ["The Semporna Archipelago is STUNNING. There are gorgeous white sand beaches, beautiful stilt houses, and of course incredible diving on offer in this little outpost at the edge of the world. However, it’s an area rife with extreme poverty, and little to no educational services on offer. The pollution of the islands is a serious problem. Walking around Mabul is a depressing up-close testament to the dangers of single use plastic. The excessive amount of tourism isn’t helping the cause, and it’s not unusual to come up from a dive amidst a sea of floating trash. While there are efforts underway to educate locals about trash maintenance, and to promote greener practices in general, it’s up to everyone to contribute to the upkeep of these beautiful islands and to help limit the footprints we leave behind. Beach clean-ups are a great way to participate and off-set the negative impact of your visit to the archipelago.", "In Semporna you’ll notice the somewhat imposing presence of the military (along with their assault weapons) all over town. This is mostly due to the historical troubles the archipelago has had with marauding pirates (yup, pirates!) coming from the semi-lawless area of southern Palawan in the Philippines, a short boat ride away. In the past there have been kidnappings of divers, for the purposes of extracting ransoms (mostly from the Chinese government). While still a terrifying consideration, there haven’t been any recent kidnapping reports, and the military presence seems to be an adequate deterrent for now.", "Recently there was an incident where two divers and a dive master were killed by dynamite fishing. The practice of dynamite fishing is illegal in the archipelago, and authorities do their best to punish offenders with heavy fines and jail time, but some manage to slip through the cracks. Not a common occurrence, but something to know about anyway.", "I had the best Tom Yum Soup of my life at Then Wang seafood restaurant next to the Billabong Scuba offices in Semporna. It involved a midnight wake-up bathroom emergency pretty much every time I ate it, but that didn’t keep me from eating it 3 nights in a row."]

      "texts": ["I found a good number of the dive shops to be impersonal, revolving doors with summer-camp like vibes, which I personally was not a fan of. This is especially true of the European-run, big name operators like Scuba Junkie. If you’re looking for a more personalized experience, opt for one of the smaller operations, although be firm about your expectations in terms of equipment and safety. I was very impressed with the staff at Billabong. Their main office is in central Semporna, but I recommend booking in advance over email. A link to their website below.", "If you are planning on going to Sipidan, or just want to hang out on Mabul for a few days, Billabong is a fantastic collection of stilt houses set atop some pretty impossibly-turquoise waters. Of all the scuba operators I spoke to on Mabul, (and I spoke to A LOT of them), Billabong was the most willing to work with my schedule, and meet me in the middle when it came to price. So many of the operators are run like scuba-summer camps, revolving doors of divers and diving permits. Billabong was different. Cute, though definitely rustic bungalows, and a beautiful open air dining area perfectly positioned to catch the famous fiery sunsets of Borneo. The food, which is included in the package cost far exceeded my expectations and the staff couldn’t be friendlier and more accommodating."]
