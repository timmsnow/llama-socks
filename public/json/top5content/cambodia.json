The journey takes about 30 minutes, it’s slightly pricier than the bus, but way cheaper than a taxi (flat $12 US fee to city center) and much more direct, with no traffic worries.\n\nBy Tuk Tuk:\nRiding in a tuk tuk is cheaper but because it’s open air, you can expect to be greeted by some pretty intense diesel fumes, especially in heavy traffic.

Make sure to keep your pass with you the entire time you’re in the park, it will be checked multiple times while you’re inside.\n\nThere are a lot of different ways to see the park. Due to its popularity, transportation to the park runs the gamut from tour-buses to helicopters, to elephant rides.", "Most people opt for a tuk-tuk tour, which you can arrange with just about any tuk-tuk driver in Siem Reap. Depending on how many temples you’re planning to see and how much time you spend in the park, you can count on spending between 12-20 USD for the day.", "I preferred renting a cheap push bike in town and cycling my way through. The terrain is flat and you won’t feel rushed or guilty about leaving your driver to wait in the heat for an hour while you explore a temple. Chances are you will sweat a little bit since the shade moves throughout the day and you might find yourself biking in the sun for some stretches, so you’ll want to watch your hydration levels. Bikes can be rented in Siem Reap for as little as a dollar a day. There are plenty of bike rental agencies, but I was able to score mine from my guesthouse, EASY."]

      "texts": ["started early. It gets hot, like REAL hot by the middle of the day and there is a lot of climbing and sun exposure involved. It can be a good idea to try and get the majority of your temple hopping taken care of in the morning and evening, and use the middle of the day for snacking, re-hydrating, and lazing in one of the shaded areas of the park. There are food stalls and people selling coconuts all over the place so it shouldn’t be too difficult to work out your food and drink.", "If you want to see Angkor Wat at sunrise, get ready to see some crowds. In the wee hours of the morning, everyone lines up on the hill across from the temple and waits for that big reveal. If you’re not SO worried about catching the first rays of sunlight creeping over the jagged silhouette, be a rebel and go ahead and make your way into the temple grounds. This is the only time of day that you’ll have any chance off having the place almost entirely to yourself. Because the sun is rising from behind the temple, there is plenty of light on the inside of the complex to get some great shots. You’ll have fantastic pictures of the temple, and everyone else will be packed like sardines on a hillside. You’re welcome.", "Lastly, bring a detailed map to help you navigate the place. It’s not a bad idea to map out a route beforehand to help prevent too much back-tracking, especially if you’re on a bicycle. The heat and humidity are no joke, even if it is all flat-land. I recommend going to the bigger, more exposed temples (like Bayon) in the morning or in the later afternoon. This way you can climb the stairways of these more sun-exposed places in the parts of the day when the sun is not as strong."]

If you are looking for something quieter, you can generally find good value budget accommodation on the other side of the canal in the neighborhood surrounding Wat Bo. Walk around, check out a few places. Most hotels will be willing to work with you on price and inclusions.", "A simple but clean option in the budget area around Wat Bo. Sweet Dreams has a pool, which is nice after a long hot day exploring Angkor Wat. There is also an onsite restaurant and the rooms are air conditioned. It is one of many solid options in the area and is extremely affordable.", "If you’re looking for something with less of the back-packer vibe, but still a good cheapie, Takeo offers clean, air conditioned rooms for travelers on a budget. There’s a nice rooftop terrace and a restaurant serving local and western food. Breakfast is included in the price, and they have bicycles you can use to explore Angkor Park. Everyone at Golden Takeo is friendly and accommodating."]
