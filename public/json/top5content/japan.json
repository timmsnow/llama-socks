It’s estimated that in the greater metropolitan area that number exceeds 30 million. Tokyo is the beating heart of one of the great giants of the world economy. The people here work ceaselessly, and everything in the city is designed to keep things moving. Trains run on time, pedestrian traffic is organized, and just about anything you need can be bought from a vending machine on the street while you’re heading to work. “Work hard, Party hard”, was perfected here. The 7-11 sells pressed ready-to-wear collared shirts for business men who woke up in yesterday’s clothes.\n\nBut despite its frenetic, non-stop pulse, Tokyo has an ordered calm that’s unusual for a city of its size. Actually it’s unusual for a city one tenth its size! Walking into the subway you can almost hear a pin-drop. No one is shouting, or shoving, or demanding attention. There is almost no crime to speak of, homelessness is a rare bird, and begging unheard of. Public bathrooms are plentiful and immaculate. The cultural rules that govern the human movements of the city create space in a place that would otherwise be unbearably crowded. Everyone follows the rules, and everyone gets a seat at the table. For the western visitor, it is a baffling, but refreshingly experience. This is a city that makes you feel as if anything is possible. It’s a place where everything is attainable, where modernity and innovation are designed in harmony with nature, and where civility still exists in the human sea of the city."]

This express train ain’t cheap though, it’ll run you about $3,400+ yen, over $30 USD.", "Alternatively you can take the Keisei bus, which runs between Narita and Tokyo station. It’s considerably cheaper than the express train, costing only 1,000 ¥, however it’s subject to traffic delays so depending on what time of day you are traveling, you’ll want to allow for some extra time to make it to the airport. These buses can be picked up on the street just east of Tokyo Station. Buses depart every 20 minutes and tickets can be bought from the kiosk next to the bus stop.", "Getting to and from Haneda is a much simpler affair. There are multiple train lines connecting you to the city and the ones you take depends on which neighborhood you’re headed to (obviously). The monorail will connect you to the JR Yamanote line, while the Keikyu line will connect you to Shinagawa and Yokohama. It’s fairly easy to navigate with one of the station maps, and you can purchase your tickets from the machine or at a ticket window.

If you have a JR pass, you can ride the JR line in Tokyo as part of the deal. A JR pass will not get you passage on the subway however, and a subway pass will not get you a ride on the JR line. Got it? The JR line can be convenient for reaching certain places, and you may need to use it if you’re arriving into Haneda, however the majority of Tokyo can be navigated entirely with the subway. I highly recommend downloading a Tokyo subway map app to your phone.", "Depending on where you're staying you may find yourself dependent on on of the myriad suburban train lines that criss-cross through Tokyo. These can be mildly irritating to navigate as they have to be paid for separately. Luckily there are pre-paid, chargeable cards you can use across all the companies. Look into the Pasmo and Suica cards, these will go a long way to making your travel in Tokyo a pleasureable experience."]

It’s a hilly, SUNNY, hot kind of island, especially in the spring and summer months, so the bicycle can make for a bit of a challenge, but it’s a good way to work off that okonomiyaki you’ve been storing up in your pooch. Enjoy the stunning views of the rugged landscape.", "On the south-western portion of the ring road on the way to the little village of Higawa, you can stop for a quick chat with the wild horses. There is a privately owned ranch called Uma Fureai nearby where you can arrange horse-back riding (if you aren’t too heavy for this petite breed… achem!) Oddly, there seems to be an opportunity to ride your horse into the ocean… which is weird, but I guess if you really want to you could do that.", "Higawa beach is largely touted as one of the best beaches on the island, primarily because of its long, wide, crescent shape, its shallow water, and the sea wall that protects it, providing easy swimming conditions for people who prefer a more gentle interaction with the ocean. It’s pretty to look at, but Higawa is extremely tidal, and when it’s low tide you’re gonna have a hard time making it out to the swim zone. If you’re looking for an easy, gentle place to swim, try the beach just to the west of Kubura port, or alternatively the one right in front of Sonai town.", "For the most beautiful beach on the island, you’ll want to bike about 2 kilometers east of Sonai, just past the graveyard. Here you’ll find a dirt path turn off from the main road. If you take a short walk down this dirt path you’ll find a cliff walk that will lead you down to the most gorgeous beach in all of Okinawa. If you know how to keep a secret, chances are you’ll have this place all to yourself. Just be careful ascending and descending, and don’t attempt the journey in the dark.", "Lastly, SCUBA, is the big draw for most visiting Yonaguni-jima. On top of being known for attracting large schools of the big pelagic species, (most notably hammerhead sharks), Yonaguni has one big ticket item that’s entirely unique to its waters: the mysterious underwater monument, also known as Kaitei Iseki. For me, this was a gargantuan check off my bucket list. The opportunity to come face to face with what could be the world’s only known sunken pyramidal structure was more than I could resist. This thing is an imposing edifice, built of giant step-like blocks, in that most alluring of all geometric structures: the pyramid.\n\nAlthough there are arguments for and against the legitimacy of the claim that it’s a manmade structure, diving the Kaitei Iseki is something you won’t soon forget. Conditions have to be just right in order to make the dive, as the structure is very close to the surface and turbulent waters can create a dangerous diving environment, but if you’re lucky enough to get a peek at the monument, there will be no mistaking that man-made or not, you’re truly in the presence of greatness."]

I made my journey to Kaitei Iseki with YDS (Yonaguni Dive Services), who were friendly, professional, and accommodating to all my needs and wants. They were able to make the most of my limited time on the island and provided me with several fantastic dives. Diving here is expensive, so it can be helpful if the dive operator can combine your dives with your accommodation to give you a slight discount.", "YDS has an onsite Minshuku where you can stay comfortably in simple tatami-style rooms with breakfast included for a reasonable price. Staying at Yoshimaru Minshuku was a slam dunk, since their kitchen cooks up tasty meals and the on-site bath-house is available to guests of the hotel. They even baked me a birthday cake, which was delicious, and I ate all of it, without shame.  Check out their website to make bookings and inquiries about diving AND accommodation."]
