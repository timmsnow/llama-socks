With almost 300,000 visitors annually, this is certainly a high-density tourist attraction, but for good reason: This National Reserve DELIVERS. You can pretty much think of the Masai Mara as a little northeast corner of the Serengeti that got cut off when the official country borders were drawn all those years ago. The Mara river that separates the two countries is actually the final boundary in the annual Great Migration, when millions of Africa’s great grazers make their way from the south, and cross the river to pack the Masai Mara’s greener pastures for a season. Along for the ride are all the happy hunters just waiting for an opportunity to pick one or 20 of those delicious wildebeests off from the pack.\n\nWildlife viewing here is phenomenal, and it’s more than possible to spot all of the big 5 in one day. You may even catch a beautiful spotted leopard, sleeping in a tree, with the bloody remains of a freshly killed dik dik tucked away beside him. (see above picture) MMMM. Nature."]

If you are going via public transit you may want to contact your lodge or hotel to arrange a meeting/pick up point near the park.", "This is probably the most popular option for reaching the park. It’s definitely the easiest route and probably the most expensive (ain’t that JUST the way?). If you make your safari or hotel arrangements in advance more than likely they will offer you pickup service from your Nairobi hotel. You’ll be scooped up in the morning and escorted in your private car all the way to whichever hotel you’ve reserved in the Masai Mara.\n\nThese pickups may or may not be included in the price of your Safari/Hotel, so make sure you know whats up before you commit. Mara Explorers Camp charges $150 US each way per vehicle, not per person, so this can be a good option if you’re in a group. A private car will certainly be less hassle and get you there quickly, but you’ll pay for it.", "Renting a car in Kenya is something that’s easier than it sounds. It isn’t actually all that expensive, and if there are a few of you traveling together it can be a cost effective, time-efficient, and exciting way to get around the country. It’s about 270 kilometers from Nairobi to the park, which means you can count on anywhere from a 5-8 hour journey in the car. It’s wildly variable because there is no accounting for traffic in Kenya. It may take an hour or two just to get yourself out of Nairobi, not to mention navigating around the countless gigantic lorries that plow the two lane highways, stalling everyone behind them.\n\nDriving in Kenya is not easy driving. Nairobi is chaotic and it’s imperative that you stay alert when driving anywhere in the city. Outside of the city is no cake walk either. Check out the information in the Transit section of the main Kenya page here for a little advice.", "The roads are fully paved to Narok, which is essentially the half-way point, and a good place to eat a meal and make a last minute stop at the ATM, but after that the tarred road cuts in and out. If you are planning to drive yourself to the park, make sure you are comfortable driving in a 4×4 and that it is outfitted with spare tires and all the things you need to change it. Having a little experience on unpaved, potholed roads would be helpful as well. Currently there is a Chinese company working on the highway between Narok and the park, so it should, in theory, be tarred and ready very soon, which will greatly reduce the amount of drive time, but it’s still a good idea to budget MORE time than you think you need, because out here, you really really never know.", "Well, look who has a budget!

It will be a hot, dusty, and crowded ride but getting to the Masai Mara via Matatu will end up costing you about $10-12 USD per person, by far your most economical option. Given that experience with public transit is highly variable and subject to all kinds of… interruptions, the route to the Masai Mara is surprisingly pretty straight forward. I managed to make the trip in about 6 hours INLCUDING a short lunch break in Narok. This is a best case scenario. I advise leaving as early as possible and  budgeting 8 hours for the trip, just in case things don’t go exactly as planned. Here’s how you do it:", "Catch any Matatu bound for Narok leaving out of Nairobi. You can either catch them from Nyamakima in the CBD, or if you want to avoid the downtown area you can head to Kikuyu Junction on the A104 and pick up a matutu going from there. The upside to this is that you will already be out of Nairobi, so you get to skip the city traffic. This is an especially good option if you are staying in the Westlands, or any of the suburbs west of central Nairobi. You can also avoid the chaos and semi-sketchiness of the downtown bus station. Make sure you get in a matatu that is actually going direct to Narok. Many of them are going to Nakuru, and will offer to drop you at a junction where you can pick up another matatu to Narok. You can take that option if you like, but you shouldn’t have a problem getting a direct bus if you give it a few minutes. This trip should cost you about 400 KSH or $4 US. They may charge an extra dollar or two for your bags, or just because they feel like it. It will still be an extremely cheap ride.", "When you arrive in Narok, the matatu will drop you off on the main highway by a gas station. On this street you can find ATMS, including a Barclays. To your right is the center of town. My advice is to walk (or take a motor taxi) a few blocks along the main street to the traffic lights at the bottom of the hill. If you hang a right here it’s a few blocks up to the Naivas supermarket. You can stock up on any essentials here and have a quick bite if you’re hungry.", "The bus station is just across the street from Naivas and it’s here that you will get in a shared taxi heading to the Sekenani gate of the Masai Mara park. Take a deep breath before you head over. You’ll be spotted pretty much immediately and more than likely a melee will ensue with about 5-10 shared taxi drivers vying for your patronage. Go for the car with the most people already in it since these cars leave when they’re full. Negotiate your price before committing. 6-700 KSH per person is fair.", "Once you’re on your way you’re pretty much all set. The shared taxi may make a few stops to drop off or pick up passengers. If your hotel or lodge is before the Sekenani gate, make sure to tell the taxi driver in advance. If you are staying in the park itself, have a driver from your lodge meet you at the gate.\n\nIf you want to return to Nairobi the same way you left it you can essentially follow the same path in reverse. The only problem is that there is no set time for the shared taxi to scoop you up on the morning of your departure. You basically need to wait on the main road between 6-10 am for one to pass by.

They have different levels of accommodation options, from camping to private bungalows, and while I wouldn’t classify it as a fancy camp, it’s comfortable enough and provides everything you need to feel at home in the savannah. A big benefit to staying here is that they arrange group safaris. This means you’ll be getting a group rate of US $60 per person for a 12 hour trip into the reserve. The price is the same whether it’s two people or six, so you could luck out like I did with a private safari for a fraction of the cost.", "Private Safaris range greatly in price. It depends on time of year and what is included. Most Safaris will be sold as part of a package with accommodation, transit, meals, etc included. I really can’t advise you here on what to pay as the options are pretty much limitless. Private safari packages can range from $700-1400 (and beyond) per person for a 2 night all inclusive. If you go the budget route, as we did, using public transit and group safari rates, a 2 night, 3 day safari experience can be had for as low as $300 including everything but park fees.

This means you have to cross by ferry.

That’s right, those adorable little death traps that ply the highways all across Kenya are available here and ready to whisk you away to your dream beach getaway.

Not only will it be safer in general, but you’ll have a rested head that you can navigate this less-than-direct route with. Here’s how you do it:\n\nStep 1 - Get To The Ferry\nFrom central Mombasa, walk or take a tuk tuk to the river ferry. Cars have to queue, but you can follow the flow of pedestrians making their way toward the boat. As a pedestrian you will not be charged anything to get on the ferry.\n\nStep 2 - Cross The River\nOnce on the ferry, find a good place to plop down with all of your stuff. Try to pick an area that isn’t isolated, maybe look for groups of women and children. This ferry is prime pick-pocket territory, so you’ll want to keep all of your stuff close.\n\nStep 3 - Matutu to Ukunda\nOnce across the river (5-10 mins), you’ll walk straight along the road until you see the matatus. You can’t miss them, but feel free to ask for directions if you’re feeling unsure. They will pretty much all be going to Ukunda, the closest town to Diani served by Matatus. It should take about 1 hour to reach Ukunda. If you tell them you want to go to Diani, they will let you out at the T Junction. It shouldn’t cost more than 100 KSH to get there, although, like always, if you have a lot of bags you may need to negotiate.\n\nStep 4 - Tuk tuk to Diani\nAt the T Junction you will see signs for Diani. Here you can pick up any tuk tuk from the main road, there are a million of them. Just negotiate the price and you’ll be on your way. Chances are you may have trouble getting a good deal if you have all your bags. Expect to pay anywhere from 200-500 KSH depending on where in Diani you are actually going. There are a million tuk tuk drivers here, all competing for a fare. If you end up paying a dollar more than the going rate, it’s going to mean a lot more to him than it will to you.

If you’re in need of a good Gelato, this is your stop. The nearby airport makes onward travel easy-peesy.", "THIS place. If you’re looking for the best food in Kilifi, and an all-around lovely afternoon, head to this simple little outpost right across the creek from Takuangu Beach. Taking a tuk tuk or boda boda is really the only way to reach this out-of-the-way property, and it may require a small amount of effort to explain where you’re trying to go. Bring a map just in case. The people at the Food Movement serve up some incredible Swahili fusion, with a fresh, rotating daily menu. Seriously some of the best food I had in Kenya, for incredibly cheap. The dishes here are made with love and the ambience of the peaceful surrounds are more than enough to encourage some lazy afternoon hangs. When you’ve finished gorging, the staff can arrange your transit back, or you can check out Takuangu Beach, stunning in it’s own right."]

All of the ablutions are compost toilets, which may not smell great, but go a long way to keeping the grounds green, literally. Distant Relatives is definitely something of a local hotspot, as the bar and restaurant are open to the public. The party can linger a little longer than some might like, so if you prefer seclusion, you might want to look elsewhere. All in all however, it’s a beautiful location with plenty of cozy hideaways tucked seamlessly into the garden."]

The isolation of the park generates the type of wild-African atmosphere modern day travelers dream about, while at the same time keeping the accommodation and safari costs lower than in other, more easily accessible parks.\n\nThe entire park is extremely well signposted, so it’s a great place to embark on your very own self-drive safari.

While driving in Kenya may be intimidating to some, it is a great way to see a lot of the country that’s otherwise inaccessible. There are two ways you can drive to Meru from Nairobi.

Pass through the town and find the road to Muthara.\n\nOnce in Muthara, make a right onto the main highway (c91) in the opposite direction of Meru and you will be getting close.

You can follow the fencing until you find a place where the fencing can be moved. You can move the fencing yourself and drive into the sanctuary here, just make sure to close the fence behind you. Once inside, a short distance from the fence, you will see a small camp where a few rangers stay. Feel free to drop by and ask about the Rhinos.
