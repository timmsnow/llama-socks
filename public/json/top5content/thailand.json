Ironically it’s poor little Phi Phi that has to suffer the onslaught of the nearly 40 million tourists looking for love and Leonardo DiCaprio on its admittedly beautiful, but tiny, fragile little beach, and while Ang Thong is a popular day destination for some tourists, its status as a national park tempers the crowds and keeps what’s best about the islands, off the tourist radar."]

While I am sure you could find someone willing to take you from the mainland for the right price, getting to the archipelago is a somewhat regulated affair, and as far as I am aware the only legal way to access the national park is with one of the organized boat tours that visits the islands from Koh Phangan (or Koh Samui).\n\nNow I know what you’re thinking. “An organized BOAT tour??? You mean like hordes of tourists with color coded name tags? Organized kayaking??

A Thailand of quiet, empty beaches, peaceful afternoons, and void of flashy restaurants with ambient techno music and neon signs promising free wifi. Trust me, it wasn’t always like this. That’s the high that we’re chasing ladies and gentlemen, and that’s exactly what we’ve come here to get.", "Now admittedly, it’s not going to feel very peaceful on the gigantic tourist ferry that’s taking you and your tour mates on this “day trip” to the islands. There will be about 100 of you, and you’ll all be experiencing varying levels of discomfort in your scratchy life vests. You’ll hear the tour leader on a megaphone speaking to you about what time lunch starts, and if it happens to be the day after your friends wedding and you are extremely hungover, take it from me, none of this will come anywhere near making you glad you got out of bed at 7am to join this tour. But hang tight. Like I said, this one is worth it.", "The tour itself is several hours long, and involves you kayaking to various locations around the archipelago. It’s exceptionally beautiful, and although a bit crowded, it’s definitely worthwhile. Watching 100 uncoordinated tourists deposit themselves into shaky kayaks is enough for a good chuckle, if nothing else. Again, being hungover = less fun than NOT being hungover, so my advise is to try not to be hungover. Skip the wedding. Is he really that good of a friend anyway? … I digress.", "No matter which tour company you end up going with, undoubtedly you will be visiting the Emerald Lagoon. It’s a bit of a hike to reach the top, but once you’re there, you are rewarded with a jaw-dropping 360° view of the archipelago, not to mention the lagoon itself, which is a dead ringer for the computer-generated backdrop they edited into “The Beach”. Some say if you squint your eyes and listen reeeeal good, the ghost of MOBY’s voluminous head of hair may just pop out and whistle a sweet techno tune into your eager ears.", "After lunch the boat will take you to the main island of the archipelago, where you are set free to explore as you see fit. This portion of the tour can be mildly irritating as all of the tours converge here for the last couple hours before they return to Koh Samui/Phangan meaning that things can get a *bit* crowded, but if you’ve been to other popular beaches in Thailand, like Raileh, or Phi Phi, don’t worry, this is absolutely nothing compared to those crowds. There is a little restaurant (with beer), a tourist shop, a few hikes you can check out, and a long, beautiful stretch of postcard-perfect beach for you to plop your hungover ass onto while you wait for the tour to end.\n\nIf you are staying overnight, go ahead and make your way to the Park Office and check in immediately when you get to the island.", "And then around 4pm… the magic begins. At first it’s just a trickle… you start to notice the beach thinning out a little. And then in droves they leave, all of them, scurrying back to the boats from whence they came, a mass exodus of day trippers, taking with them their noise and their cell phones and their screaming children.\n\nAnd you? Where are you? Still on the beach? Alone? ……On this beautiful, pristine piece of Thai perfection?! Yes. You get to stay. You planned this out ahead of time. Everyone else has to leave. But you, you’re Leonardo Dicaprio. Welcome to Thailand of 1995. It’s just you, and the monkeys, and however many cold beers the restaurant has left. It’s open til 9pm."]

The national park service has a small circle of cabins on the main island that are available for nightly rental. The majority of them are basic, one room affairs but all come equipped with screened windows, a fan, working electricity, and private bathrooms. These cabins can be rented for about 400 baht a night, or just over $10 USD. In addition to the cabins, tents are available for rent with shared bathroom access. You can also pitch your own tent in the designated camping area. All of the accommodation is first come, first serve, or can be reserved through this Thai website. The last time I tried to use the website however, a Thai bank account was required to make the booking so you may have some difficulty navigating through that roadblock.", "If you’re having trouble booking through the site, you can just do as I did and just show up. While there is always a risk involved when not pre-booking, because the vast majority of visitors to Ang Thong aren’t even aware that staying the night is an option (and most tour operators don’t even mention this when offering the tour), chances are there will be VERY few people overnighting, and you are more than likely going to have no problem just showing up and claiming your spot. There are 6 cabins, and multiple tents, and in the extremely unlikely scenario in which all were taken, you can always just head back to the mainland with the rest of the day trippers. It’s a pretty low risk scenario.", "After working out your return details with the tour operator, you can essentially choose whatever level of participation you like during the tour portion of the day. Once you make it to the main island (generally around 1pm), you can head directly to the National Park Office and register yourself for your overnight stay. Bring enough cash to pay for your room as well as any meals/beer you plan to take while on the island.

Maybe you can challenge them to a rousing game of snap and congratulate yourselves on making it to this secret Thai paradise.", "After a blissfully quiet night’s sleep, you’ll have the entire island to yourself for another few hours. The day trippers don’t land until around lunch-time, which means you get to soak it up on an empty beach. Then it’s three to four hours of mild chaos before you can catch your ride back. I recommend giving yourself at least two nights here.

The bus station is a short ride to both the center of town and the pier where you catch the ferry, and there are both Songthaew’s and Moto-taxis available to take you the rest of the way. The Songthaew to the pier shouldn’t cost more than about 50 baht.", "Depending on where you are coming from in Thailand, and what time you’re departing, you may not make it in time to catch the last ferry to Koh Phayam, which generally departs at 2pm (although there could be some seasonal variation). If you don’t want to spend the night in Ranong, make sure to leave early so you can catch that ferry.", "If you’d rather take it slow, or you just find yourself arriving too late in the day, there are worse places you could be stuck than in Ranong. I arrived after the last ferry and ended up spending the night in the city center, at a place called Dahla House. It was clean, cheap, and conveniently located near plenty of restaurants and a cute little night market. It’s easy enough to grab the Songthaew or a motorbike taxi to the pier first thing in the morning.", "The slow ferry leaves every day at 9:30 am and 2 pm, and takes about 2 hours to reach the island from the port. There is a fast ferry service available during peak season that operates a few times a day from 7am-2pm, but only from November-May(ish). The fast ferry should only take about 45 minutes and is about double the price of the slow ferry. On your way to Koh Phayam you will pass by Koh Chang, Koh Phayam’s sister island. NOT to be confused with the OTHER Koh Chang, which is located near the Cambodian border, THIS Koh Chang is an even quieter island, with limited electricity and a very detached atmosphere. If you have time it can be worth a night or two to soak in the tranquility of this barely-on-the-map island. Just know that it’s for-real quiet, and it may behoove you to bring some supplies in case the shops are closed or empty.\n\nNote that the ferries can not leave after 2pm because the tide is too low and the boats can’t reach the pier. In fact the scheduling can be a bit delayed depending on how quickly the tide rises. If you are taking the early ferries, you may have to wait for the tide to rise properly before you get moving.", "Once you are on the island you can either take Moto-taxi’s to get around, or you can hire your own scooter. I highly recommend the latter as it will make your life infinitely easier. You can rent one in the main town where the boat drops you off. You’ll be returning it to the same port when you leave, so that just buttons up perfectly doesn’t it? Once you have your own wheels you’ll have free reign over the whole island.

It’s extremely easy to get away from any and every person if you just walk a little bit down the beach. Those living on the island often opt to ride their motor-bikes across the long swaths of empty sand rather than schlub it in the hot sun. This beach faces the Andaman sea and so is a little more spunky than the protected bay of Ao Khao Kwai. If you prefer some waves and salty sea spray, as well as a little more activity and photogenic sunsets, this is probably the side you want to stay on.", "Buffalo Bay is on located on the eastern side of the island and is calmer, in terms of water as well as atmosphere. There are only a few little beach resorts here, spread along the length of the bay so you can expect quiet nights and lot’s of space to lay your beach towel down during the day. One thing to note is that the water here is extremely tidal, and so for a good portion of the day it’s almost un-swimmable, or at least a long walk to GET to a depth higher than your ankle. Once the tide comes in though, it’s a delightful beach that dishes up an incomparable level of chill.", "On the northern tip of the island, not too far from Buffalo Bay is the little beach cove of Monkey Beach. It’s a good idea to ask a local for directions before heading there. Also note that the road is unpaved, so in order to avoid scuffing up your rental, you may want to park your scooter and walk the final portion of the route. It is a little bit hidden, but Monkey Beach is a beautiful slice of hidden paradise and well worth the trip. It’s as quiet and paradisiacal as they come, with less extreme tides than the other beaches, making it a good option for those wanting to go swimming.", "The entire island has a sort of “live and let live” vibration, so it’s best to jump on that bandwagon if you plan on visiting. Don’t plan on doing too much with your day. This is the place you come to catch up on your reading, do a little yoga, and relax like you’ve never chilled before.

Any damage that the bike accrues during the time you rent it is your responsibility, and if you want that passport back you’re going to have to pony up if there’s a problem.", "Always give the bike a thorough once-over. Note any and all damage to the body. Check the mirrors, gas gauge, brakes etc before leaving the rental agency. These bikes get more riders than the teacups at Disney World, so inevitably some of them will end up being damaged or a little faulty. I once had one rented to me that was leaking gasoline.. like a lot. Yikes. If you notice anything wrong, exchange it for another bike. Better than arguing with them later when you bring it back after the fact.", "Once you have your bike you’ll be able to visit any number of delightful, picturesque mountain locales. Ask the bike rental agency for a map of the local area, it should come free with the rental. There are waterfalls, hiking trails, canyons, hot springs, and some pretty epic view points to enjoy in the surrounding area. Ask around about some of the local farms, a lot of them are open to the public and you can stop by for a tour of the grounds to get a glimpse what rural Thai life is like, or at least some version of rural Thai life. Places like the Village Farm and The Land Split can be worthwhile stops on the way home after a day exploring."]

While mostly geared toward the backpacker demographic, the accommodation in Pai runs the gamut from basic wooden bungalows to luxury resorts. While I don’t know much about the latter, I can tell you there is a plethora of CHEAP, basic budget accommodation available right in the middle of town.", "For those looking for something a little different, it’s worth checking out Tacomepai. A sort of eco-farm/commune, Tacomepai is a working organic farm with a hardline ethos based on the permaculture principles. Think: allllll natural wonderland. I visited Tacomepai years ago, before their operation really got off the ground, and had a lovely experience walking the grounds and chatting with the owners, they even helped me make a traditional Loy Kratong for the upcoming festival.. just cause they wanted to show me how. Spending an afternoon on the grounds is a blissful experience and even if you aren’t particularly green (which… these days, why AREN’T you?), you can’t help but appreciate the intrinsic beauty of their earnest and heartfelt operation. If you want to spend a little more time here, you can volunteer to help on the farm. It’s a special opportunity to really get away from the grind, and you’ll get simple accommodation and vegan meals in return for your efforts. When in Pai!"]

YES, she’s crowded. YES, there is almost NO budget accommodation to be had… and YES getting on and off the “island” is a shit show… but there’s just something about Raileh. Once you get into the groove and learn to dance along to her hectic, but immensely beautiful tune… this place can really show you something special. Just, maybe avoid the main beaches from 11am-4pm… everyday. Maybe take a nap instead. Did I mention it’s a busy place?"

The two main access points to get to Rai Leh are:", "The town of Krabi can be a good option because of it’s accessibility. It’s a large town, with an airport, and is serviced by numerous bus lines making it extremely easy to get in and out of. Once in Krabi proper, you’ll want to head to the port where you can grab one of the boats to Rai Leh, which dock at Rai Leh East Beach, a beach with a pier, and no need to wade through the ocean.", "Neighboring Ao Nang Beach, just west of the peninsula, about a 10 minute boat ride from Raileh. The small boats making the journey from Ao Nang to Raileh have a minimum passenger requirement of 8 people, which means regardless of if you’re coming or going, you may have to wait for enough people to join you to make the trip. This boat also doesn’t dock at a pier, meaning you’ll need to wade through sea water that is at a minimum shin-deep, and often much deeper. Wear a bathing suit.", "There are also ferries that connect Rai Leh to Koh Lipe, as well as Koh Phi Phi, among others. They aren’t particularly cheap, but if you’re heading that way anyway, it’s a great time saver. This is one of the hotspots for getting to Koh Phi Phi, and you’ll see signs and tour agencies everywhere advertising the trip. If that’s something you’re up for, be my guest… but gird your loins. If you think the crowds are bad in Rai Leh, just wait for Phi Phi.\n\nDepartures to/from the other islands like Phi Phi and Koh Lanta generally leave from Raileh West Beach."]

Rai Leh East (where the boats from Krabi dock), Rai Leh West (where you take the boat to Ao Nang), cute little Tonsai, and the ever popular Phra Nang Beach. There is accommodation on all of the beaches except Phra Nang, with Tonsai being more geared toward the younger backpacking crowd, and everywhere else being the up-market resort crowd. During the day, Rai Leh is awash with hordes of day-trippers and tour groups, and it can all be a little overwhelming. All of the beaches get a considerable crowd, although there are some important differences to remember.", "The majority of the day-trippers will march directly to Phra Nang, as it is the most famous. It’s a beautiful beach and a great place to take a kayak out onto the open water for a little karst exploration, but because of its popularity I don’t recommend making this your home base. Rai Leh East is a little meh in my opinion, although locals find a respite from the crowds here among the mangroves. Rai Leh West is a beach front lined with resorts. It’s busy, but extends pretty far to the west, so finding a comfortable spot is doable, just note there is little to no shade on this side of the peninsula, so having an umbrella can be a god-send.", "My personal favorite beach is cute little Tonsai beach.. and not JUST because they sell you magic mushrooms milkshakes with dolphins carved out of bananas…. that’s simply the cherry on an already delicious limestone sundae. Tonsai is the least accessible of Rai Leh’s beaches, and as a result is quieter, more relaxed, and easier to enjoy. There are two ways to reach Tonsai by foot. You can either hike 30 minutes along a path behind the last resort in the northern part of the peninsula, which takes you over the mountains to the back part of Tonsai, where all the bungalows are, OR you can follow the shorter, 10 minute path over a rocky outcropping along the coast from Rai Leh West, however this option disappears during high tide so it’s best to make the journey back before sunset if you don’t want to be forced to make a thirty minute hike in the dark.", "After about 3 or 4pm the day trippers start to fizzle out and ALL of the beaches mellow out considerably. The entire peninsula slips into a lulled afternoon nap and everyone breaths a collective sigh of relief. This is magic hour, when you can enjoy the last golden rays of the afternoon sun while sipping a cold one on a sparsely populated beach.\n\nAt night Rai Leh is a different place entirely. While there are restaurants and bars that have a somewhat buzzy vibe to them, for the most part everyone goes to bed early, and you’ll feel as though you have the whole place to yourself. This is the perfect time to partake in a night swim, or lay on the beach counting the stars. It’s a surprisingly peaceful place, and one you’ll be really glad you came to."]

There are several rock-climbing schools, some that offer “over the water” climbing, and rope-free options… chances are if you’re here for that, you’re going to find what interests you. They charge by the day or the 1/2 day.", "There are a few hikes you can go on in the area as well. The most notable being the hike up the mountain just behind Phra Nang Beach. There is a somewhat vertiginous climb up to an impressive viewpoint, (I recommend NOT attempting this in flip flops), and an even more difficult climb DOWN to a lagoon. It is not easy. Honestly, this is a slippery, dangerous, difficult climb and you absolutely should not attempt it alone. If you’re feeling even a little bit nervous about the climb down, abort your mission. Falling looks extremely painful and not fun."]

Almost everywhere else in Rai Leh proper is high-priced and geared toward families or more luxury travel. That being said there is one place in Rai Leh that still rents bungalows for cheap.", "Railey Cabana Garden Bungalows, is a bit of a mouth-full, but is the only place in Rai Leh proper where you can find a good cheap deal. It is located at the very north of town, just before the mountain path to Tonsai, and is about a 10-15 minute walk uphill from the beach. The nice thing about the location is that it’s extremely quiet. The cabins themselves are set on a rural plot of land with chickens and other free-roaming animals sharing the space with you. There are no outlets in the cabins, but the front desk is more than happy to let you charge your various electronic accoutrement with them. They don’t have a website, but Rai Leh can get busy especially during the holidays so it’s not a bad idea to give them a call or shoot them an email to make a reservation. No payment will be needed to hold it. They’re old school like that, which is just the way we like it."]
