The one in green crayon, with one conical volcano, a couple palm trees, and an idyllic calm azure sea lapping up on the perfect sandy beach? Maybe a shark fin or two sticking up a bit offshore? Camiguin is that island. Except with a lot more palm trees and fewer sharks. This magical, dynamic, heartbreakingly beautiful island is comprised of 7 different volcanos, (two of which are still classified as active), making it a hotbed of seismic activity. Over the years various eruptions and earthquakes have led to the destruction and rebirth of various sections of the island, and so despite the presence of a state of the art volcanic research center in the middle of the island, the people of Camiguin remain acutely aware of the sleeping giants that dominate the landscape.\n\nWhile all this exploding has created some difficulties for the islands inhabitants in the past, that same volatility has also bestowed Camiguin with exceptional natural beauty. Fertile volcanic soil has given rise to a lush and productive jungle environment, creating a unique and thriving ecosystem of which the locals are immensely proud and protective. The people of Camiguin love their island, and stand united in their actions to protect the environment. Unlike much of the Philippines, you would be hard-pressed to find trash in the streets here. Everyone pitches in to do their part to take care of their beloved island, and to keep Camiguin green.\n\nAnd all of this idyllic, tropical island magic is ringed by 360° of magnificent black sand beach… the majority of which is empty, quiet, and begging you to set up shop and forget the world. Throw in a couple pristine uninhabited offshore islands and you’ve got yourself a 100% genuine, Real-Mccoy tropical paradise."]

Balbagon, in the north of the island, which has services to/from Jagna on the island of Bohol, and Benoni Port on the east coast, with services to/from Mindanao. Getting to Camiguin by ferry can be a good, cheap option, but you have to remember several things.\n\n1 - Ferries can and do get canceled with relative frequency due to rough seas between Bohol and Camiguin. If you are planning on arriving/departing by ferry, give yourself an extra day of wiggle room on either end to allow for any possible cancelations.\n\n2 - The ports of Jagna (Bohol) and Balingoan (Mindanao) require some effort of their own to get to. Jagna can be reached by bus from anywhere on Bohol but it can take a few hours, so factor that into your itinerary. Getting around Mindanao is its own sack of rocks, so if you aren’t already in Mindanao, I wouldn’t recommend going just to grab the boat, although it does operate with more frequency and less cancelations.\n\nOne of the advantages that Camiguin has is that it’s off the regular tourist circuit. It’s *just* far enough from Bohol to make the trip mildly inconvenient, which stops a lot of people from going. For now, there is one ferry a day operated by Super Shuttle Ferries, which departs from Jagna, Bohol at 1pm daily. I wouldn’t be surprised if more trips get added as a result of the growing popularity of the island.\n\nThere are up to 10 ferries making the much shorter trip from Mindanao daily.", "There are daily flights from Cebu City and Manila. It’s a short flight in a cute little puddle-jumper and it’s not expensive. I highly recommend this option, at least for GETTING TO the island.

While many people tout Sagada as THE northern destination for travelers looking for a change of pace from the countless paradisiacal beaches, for me, my heart was won by the sweet simplicity and unassuming air of the little mountain town of Banaue. Don’t get me wrong, Sagada is beautiful. There are caves, waterfalls, hikes, and hanging coffins to be explored and enjoyed, it’s a truly special location.\n\nThe problem with Sagada is that the tourism board is absolutely aware of its position and popularity, and pretty much everything there is off-limits without a guide. Now, there are plenty of times when a guide is not only 100% worth it, some times it’s 100% needed for your own safety, and I am completely on-board with supporting local guides who rely on the tourist economy for their income, but in Sagada they take it to a whole new level. Even the most basic of hikes will require a guide. Every waterfall, forest, cave, and hiking trail has been turned into a commodity… and frankly, it’s a bit exhausting. Not cheap either. While there are some fantastic sights in Sagada, easy-going Banaue is a wonderful place to catch your breath and have some hassle-free mountain time.\n\nThe biggest draw for those visiting Banaue are the spell-binding rice terraces that blanket the surrounding mountains and offer stunning panoramic views. The terraces are thought to be 2000 years old and were originally carved out by the local Ifugao people as a means of creating cultivatable land in the otherwise un-farmable mountains of northern Luzon. Many of the original terrace infrastructure is still in use today, and a day spent exploring and walking through the small villages that line the mountaintops makes for some pretty epic views of this expansive and ancient feat of engineering."]

I had never heard of it, knew nothing about it, and had never met anyone who had been. It was only after taking the flight from Cebu City to Puerto Princessa, Palawan, and passing by one of those tourism advisory board posters that line the hallways of the airport that I even realized San Vicente was a place. I’m a sucker for a poster of a palm-tree lined white sand beach, even in a country literally PACKED with palm tree-lined white sand beaches. It looked nice. “San Vicente… huh. Where’s that?” I thought, before continuing on my merry way.\n\nIn the middle of nowhere, it turns out. While San Vicente Town is a real enough place, the San Vicente of the tourism board posters is not exactly a precise location, but more of an abstract idea. An area. A province if you will, and it’s really quite large. The tourist friendly town of Port Barton is actually inside the district of San Vicente, but once you go north from there, things get a whole lot more remote.\n\nI might not have ever stopped on the long stretch of coastline that begins just north of Port Barton and extends to the south of El Nido, except that I was having some difficulty getting OUT of Port Barton on my way up to El Nido. I’ll spare you the details, but it’s a great story that involves all the usual traveler misfortune one can come to expect when relying on Jeepneys as your primary form of transit.\n\nAnyway, I managed to secure a boat out of Port Barton with a couple of fellow travelers who happened to be heading to the Peace and Love Hotel in San Vicente. “OH YES!” I remembered, “San Vicente!” And despite another arduous journey involving a very angry man, his machete, and a subsequent police escort… I was on my way to enjoying the beautifully unspoiled beaches of wild and remote San Vicente."

      "texts": ["Well in order to explain the best way to make it here, I’ll have to give you an actual place to get to. I spent my time in San Vicente on Long Beach, just to the north of San Vicente town proper. Staying at the Peace and Love Hotel on the hill top is an excellent and comfortable option if you want to keep one foot in modernity. If you’re looking for a proper get-away from it all, head to Turublien Long Beach Hotel. It’s about a 30-40 minute walk along the beach from Peace and Love/San Vicente town, and miles away from your usual tourist hotel.", "Like an oasis in the desert of a VERY long and appropriately named beach, Turublien is a small guesthouse with very rustic and simple rooms, an extremely friendly and enthusiastic host, and one hard-working karaoke machine. The chances of you having this gorgeous stretch of unadulterated beach all to yourself are pretty high. Very few people make it out to Turublien, and those that do often drop by for an hour or two and then head back to town.\n\nSupplies are driven to the Hotel by motorbike along the beach, so if you have any specific requests you’ll want to let the owner/manager know before it’s delivery time. There is no onsite restaurant (orders are taken and food is cooked at a seemingly random basis, so bring some back-up snacks if you can), and certainly no wifi. Turublien is the place you come to forget where you were going, and I highly recommend it."]

      "texts": ["It’s extremely easy to spend your days lazing away on the beach, and as long as there’s enough cold beer on-site, just as easy to while the night away in front of the intimate light of the karaoke machine. This is Philippino realness. Just you, your new local friends, some fresh caught fish, and *hopefully* a cold San Miguel to wash it all down with.", "Do note that due to the remote location the beach is all natural and un-manicured. This can result in certain patches of sand harboring those little bitty bastards, the sand fleas. If you’re allergic or particularly averse, you may want to give this a skip, or wait until the afternoon to enjoy the beach when they seem to calm down."]

      "texts": ["It’s easy enough to charter a boat, as I did from Port Barton to San Vicente Town. It takes about 2-3 hours and split between a few people, the cost shouldn’t be ruinous. The price is absolutely negotiable, you simply need to work it out with any of the more than willing boat captains that hang around the beach front in Port Barton. Just make sure the captain is actually licensed, otherwise the coast guard could end up canceling your trip… and really pissing off a sensitive, unlicensed boat man… but that’s a story for another time.", "Getting to San Vicente by road is a little more difficult. Without your own vehicle you’re looking at getting a bus up the highway to one of the main junctions that splits off and heads west toward San Vicente town. From there you would more than likely need to secure a taxi, or failing that, hitch-hike. It would not make for an easy day.\n\nAnd ...should you find yourself being threatened with a machete by an irate, unlicensed boat captain in Port Barton like we were, you may want to seek the services of a police escort. THANKS GUYS!", "My personal recommendation would be to catch the boat from Port Barton to San Vicente Town. From the town you can hoof it down the beach to Turublien.\n\nWhen you’re ready to leave, have your new friends assist you with getting a ride out. The guys at Turublien are more than happy to arrange a beach pickup (motorbike) that’ll whisk you away to a meet-up point with a (cheap) local taxi, that can then connect you with the main highway and the rest of Palawan along with it. While it may sound like a lot, this actually very do-able, so if you’re up for a bit of a challenge… give it a go!"]

      "texts": ["I’ve already given you the run down on Turublien, but here’s my official review for you anyway.", "For something truly, truly unique, head to this remote outpost. Long beach is, well, extremely long, and there are only a handful of hotels and guesthouses set up to receive people. Turublien is run by a small, but extremely enthusiastic and friendly staff who do it all for you: the cooking, the cleaning, the karaoke-ing…. You feel a million miles away from civilization here as you have kilometers on end of empty beach running on either side from the hotel. It’s extremely remote, but not remote enough that you won’t be able to get a cold beer, which they make sure to stock when they get their daily moped delivery. The rooms themselves are on the other side of a fresh water canal, which you have to pull yourself across on a floating pontoon boat. This is wild beach Palawan land, so it can be a little buggy, bring mosquito repellent.", "Before we discovered little Turublien down below, we first stumbled into the Peace and Love Hotel. It had been a long day of semi-traumatic experiences involving an angry man with a machete and (thankfully) a police escort, and the wood-fired pizza they were serving up was greatly welcomed. Typically I shy away from the higher-end resorts but this place was actually really affordable for the quality of the rooms. The view overlooking the bay and surrounding islands was incredible and made for perfect sundowner material, so perfect that I have to admit… there may have been a selfie situation in the infinity pool.
