      "texts": ["If you are here to climb, there are a few things to keep in mind when planning your ascent up Kilimanjaro.\n\nFirstly, making this climb is more than likely a once in a lifetime opportunity, and you should treat it as such. Don’t skimp on price here, as not only will the quality of your experience depend on it, but so will your safety, and the ethical treatment of those assisting you in your hike. There are a number of companies you can hike with. TONS actually, and they range from $1,200 (barebones) all the way to $8,000+ (for luxury).", "The cheapest and shortest hikes will be 5 day, 4 night packages up the Marangu Route, which is often considered the easiest, most direct route. However, because it’s the quickest, those who aren’t accustomed to high altitudes may not acclimatize quickly enough to make it to the summit. You may want to consider stretching your trek out by adding an extra day to acclimatize, even if it costs a little extra.", "Budget hikes lasting the ideal length of about 7 days will run you about $1700-2000 including park fees. This will be a barebones operation where you will be mostly sleeping in tents, with little in the way of creature comforts. But all meals, guides, and porter services will be included, excluding the customary tip, which should be calculated beforehand and paid at the end of a successful hike.", "Mid-range hikes which will probably include airport transfers and more comfortable accommodations (think nicer tents with private toilets) will run you $2,000-2,500.", "Luxury hikes with hot water showers start in the $2,500-3,000 range, and it goes up from there depending on what add-ons you want to… add on.", "Tipping is a big part of Kilimanjaro’s hiking culture. Consider it mandatory. This is a huge part of the salary of those assisting you on your hike and they depend on the tip money to live. A good rule for tipping is as follows, but if you want to tip more that’s never unwelcome:\n\n$20-30 per guide per day.\n$10 per day for each porter that assisted you\n$10-15 per day for the cook\n$15-20 per day for any assistant guides", "Buying the right gear is essential when prepping for a hike. You’re going to be passing through some serious weather extremes on your way up the mountain. You can start your hike in 30 degree centigrade weather and suddenly find yourself wet, freezing, and confused. The weather up there is completely unpredictable and you should be outfitted for every type of climate. Most importantly, get yourself a sleeping bag for extreme temperatures. Whether you’re sleeping in a cabin or a tent, you WILL be cold at night. Equally important is water resistant hiking gear. The rain here can chill you to the bone, so come prepared.", "Bear in mind that the cheapest packages are likely NOT ethically sound, and probably involve the exploitation of the team that’s guiding and assisting you up the mountain. It’s important that you spend a little time shopping around and talking to multiple tour agencies to see the differences between them. If the price sounds too good to be true, it almost certainly is. A good first step is checking this site for confirmation about ethical standards of tour operators before you get started."]

      "texts": ["There are about 6 major routes you can take up to the summit. You’ll want to talk with different tour agencies to see which ones they offer and which ones are most suited to your tastes.", "This is the quickest, most direct route. It can be completed in five days but it’s recommended to do it in six, for an extra acclimatization day. It’s one of the more popular routes and offers hut accommodation as opposed to just tents. Still cold tho.", "This route is definitely one of the quieter routes, and takes longer to complete, but has the added bonus of a hike through a game reserve on the first day. You will likely have to pay a premium for this as an armed guard is required to travel with you in case of animal attack. FUN!", "Often considered the most beautiful of all the hikes, the Machame Route includes stunning sweeping views over the surrounding country scenery and takes about 7-8 days to complete."]

There is an obvious intention to be eco-friendly here that could stem from the amazing views of Kilimanjaro, a reminder of whats good about being green. The staff here is extremely friendly and knowledgable. Breakfast is small, but the views from where you eat it are something you will not soon forget. At Mountain Bike, prices are consistent with other budget stays in the area, but the quality here is higher than most. A great place to meet others and plan the next leg of your trip.", "This hotel FEELS like luxury, but it’s actually a low-cost midrange option dressed up in shiny new clothes. The little rondavel-style huts are cute as a button and the whole property has a relaxing vibe that’s extremely rare in budget hotels in Tanzania. The rooms are well decorated and maintained, and the garden (you knew there would be a garden) is a great place to relax in a hammock and read a book. There is an onsite restaurant with ok food, but it isn’t too far from the main drag that you can’t pop into town for dinner and drinks if you prefer. A solid mid-range option. Enjoy it while you can."]
