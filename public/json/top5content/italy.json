The beaches here are among Italy’s most beautiful, with mostly sandy, white shores and a deep turquoise sea that’s clarity might lead you to believe you were somewhere else.

The beaches here are equally stunning, and while the central beach has a snack bar, the further afield you go, the less people you’ll encounter, and believe me, there is plenty of shoreline to explore.

Of particular interest to history geeks like myself, the Museo Faggiano is a captivating walk through 2,500 years of inhabitation dug up through the layers of a single building in central Lecce.

It’s believed by some that this hilltop wonder may be the third longest inhabited settlement in the world. With several sections of the city carved entirely out of the rock face, and sitting astride a gorge of significant depth, this remarkable town seems to tumble down the sides, permanently teetering precariously on the edge of a cliff. The Sassi as they’re called, are the collections of cave-like dwellings that Matera is most known for, and after years of living in the shadow of the more prosperous new town, they have come back with a vengeance, drawing tourists from all over the world to ogle at their haphazard beauty.

If you’re new to Rome, and are looking for a night out, you can definitely find it here.", "One of my absolute favorite buildings in Rome, The Pantheon was first constructed (not physically, but like… with money), by that intriguing and instrumental general Marcus Agrippa, in the days of his benefactor, Augustus. The building itself is a massive architectural achievement who’s crowning glory is a domed roof that to this day remains the largest, un-reinforced concrete dome in the world. Talk about a legacy. The entire building is magnificent, built as an homage to the many gods of the Ancient Roman world, and when you’re inside you feel as if you’re in an elevator to the heavens. Although the Roman Catholics repurposed the ancient temple as a Christian church (as they are want to do), the interior of the Pantheon has continued to resist the usual drab, churchy feel that so often accompanies consecration. Entrance is free, but go early, since it gets crowded."]

      "texts": "On October 24th, in the year 79 AD, that old grump of a mountain Vesuvius let one rip across the area surrounding the Bay of Naples. The massive eruption could be seen for miles around, and was even described in grim detail by Pliny the younger, who witnessed the event from his uncles home in nearby Misenum. He described what he saw as “broad sheets of fire and leaping flames”, and detailed hearing “the shrieks of women, the wailing of infants, and the shouting of men”. In short, it sounds like October 24th was kind of a bad day for the people of Pompeii.\n\nIn fact Vesuvius had been making noise for a few days prior to the eruption, and a good portion of the resort town’s population had already abandoned the city in response. About 3,000 people remained in the city, or returned to gather their possessions, only to be consumed by blankets of fire and ash.\n\nWhat essentially became a living nightmare to those unfortunate people has, thanks to the work of dedicated archeologists, become something of an ancient time capsule. Nowhere in the world can the remains of an ancient city be found of this size and in such fantastic condition. In fact, much of what we know about the Romans we know thanks to the existence and preservation of Pompeii and her sister site, Herculaneum. Both sites are fascinating glimpses into the everyday lives of a people and a way of life long since buried and (mostly) forgot.\n\nTo walk the streets of Pompeii and Herculaneum is to time travel, to resurrect the past, to commune with our forebearers. These are special places, and unique opportunities. Skipping Pompeii means giving up a once in a lifetime opportunity to take a walk through time and make connections with the past."
