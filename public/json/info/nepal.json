This can make mountaineering a pretty uncomfortable experience and the already sweltering lowlands become downright swampy.", "The winter months of December-February create conditions for clear skies and consequently, the best views of the Himalayas. These months can make for some cold hiking though, so you will want to pack appropriately.", "The shoulder seasons have a happy medium. Warmer weather means more comfortable hiking, and although the mountain peaks can, at times, be obscured by cloud cover, the clouds will generally break at various points throughout the day giving you intermittent glimpses of the majestic peaks. Mornings are typically clearer than afternoons. In April the rhododendrons bloom and the pathways along the Annapurnas become a blanketed in crimson flower petals.", "At all times of the year weather in the mountains can be unpredictable. In a matter of seconds the weather can change from extremely pleasant to downright terrifying. Always bring the correct gear for any given weather. More than anything, staying dry will go a long way to making your experience a good one."]
