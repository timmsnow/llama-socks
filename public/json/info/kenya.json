Take care when driving here. (See the safety section for more information)", "Also note that traffic police operate along the highways here and you may be requested to pull over.

You can avoid any potential hassles and you get a nice picture.", "The Kenyan Consulate requires a visa application form, two passport sized photos, proof of onward travel (or return ticket), hotel reservations (usually the first couple nights are sufficient),  and the visa fee in the form of a money order or cashiers check ($50 for citizens of most countries)."]

The increase of foreign and domestic tourism means you should plan ahead and make some bookings. Expect higher prices as well.", "March, April, and the beginning of May constitute the rainy season. Prices drop significantly and a lot of places actually close up shop for a month or two. This can be a good time to go if you are trying to avoid the crowds, just make sure you have time to navigate the adverse weather and the possibility of Safari cancelations.", "January and February are a fantastic time to go. The weather is great, the animals are out, and the flood of tourists is lacking. This is also calving season, so you can expect a lot of adorable little baby-faces included in your safari.", "Keep in mind that no matter when you go, Nairobi (and other more elevated areas around Mount Kenya) are cooler than the rest of the lowland country. Pack appropriately. Also, just because it feels cooler doesn’t mean you won’t get burned. This is equator territory. If you’re lacking in the melanin department, slip, slap, slop!"]

Get you some.", "Most Kenyans will have an additional language, generally falling into the Bantu or Nilotic language families, that they speak locally within their community."]
