That means you will be required to leave the country and then come back if you would like to extend. There is a visa on arrival that is eligible for extension which you can obtain upon arrival at the airport. It is also valid for 30 days but can be extended, once at the immigration office for another 30 days.", "It’s entirely up to you which you prefer, but I had no problems with the visa free option and simply explored some neighboring countries for a few weeks in-between my visits to Indonesia. No one seemed to mind that I had been there recently and the cost of my flights were not much more than it would have been to buy the visa and extend it anyway."]

Kalimantan (Borneo) is hot, and humid, with rainfall throughout the year. If you are planning on visiting these islands just take the rain with the dry.
