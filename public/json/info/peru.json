Plug type A is the American style plug with flat prongs, however in Peru both prongs are the same size, Maning if you have any appliances with an American-style plug with one prong being slightly larger than the other, you will need an adapter. The type C plug is the style traditionally used in Europe, with two equal round prongs."]

    "texts": ["As an almost equatorial country, Peru can be visited year round, although the regions vastly differ in temperature and rainfall depending on the time of year.", "The dry season is generally considered to be from about Mid-May to the end of October. This is especially true for the Andean regions: think, Sacred Valley, Machu Picchu etc.", "January and February can be extremely wet times to visit and can make hiking along the Incan Trail somewhat messy. In fact, the Inca Trail closes during the month of February to allow for a little maintenance and a general freshen-up to get it ready for the upcoming post-rain tourism onslaught. You can still access Machu Picchu during this time, and you will definitely see less of a crowd than the during the dry months, although those that are there are sure be quite wet, so bring a poncho.", "The Amazon region is ALWAYS hot, humid, and wet. Count on daily showers. During the rainy season (approximately December-May) the amazon swells and the tiny communities along the river are slowly transformed into floating villages. In the area around Iquitos, which is a generally well trafficked by tourists, the river tends to reach it’s highest point in April and May, and a good portion of the places you could previously visit on foot will be unreachable, or only reachable by boat, making it a more nuanced and difficult endeavor.", "The coastal regions south of Lima are generally dry and hot all year. This is some of the driest desert in the world. If you’re sick of rain, come here.", "While the north coast is typically dry for the majority of the year, it can be affected by the wet season (November-May), however generally not to the point where it’s unpleasant. An average rainfall of 2″ a day can be expected in the wettest months of January/Feb, but clear skies abound once storms pass. Occasionally, about every decade or so, there are super wet seasons along the coast, causing MAJOR disruptions. In 2017 for example, as I was traveling in this area, Peru experienced its worst flooding and mudslide disasters in over two decades. The Pan-American highway, which spans the entire length of the coast was shuttered from Ecuador to Lima for over a month. Entire cities were flooded and a state of emergency had to be declared. Travel in the region came to a complete halt with many people having to be airlifted and evacuated from the coastal regions. It…. was not pretty. Fortunately rains like this are rare, and generally occur in a pattern alongside the El Niño phenomenon… but it isn’t an exact science. 2017 was an off year, and yet, still the rains fell in terrifying quantities. For this reason it can be a good idea to have an exit strategy if things start to look dicey."]
