After 30 days it is required to either extend your stay in a immigration office, or leave the country and re-enter. It is a good idea to plan on spending a few days out of the country before attempting re-entry as they have cracked down on same-day visa runs in the past. The extension is granted at most 2 times in a calendar year if crossing overland, but is unlimited if you are flying.", "Most African nationals, the majority of the middle east, select Latin Americans, and a few European countries will need to apply for a visa in advance.

Even during the rainy season the torrential downpour can come fast and leave just as quickly. If you are hoping to get some discounts and a little more personal space, traveling during the monsoon can be a good way to get it.", "Festivals like the Vegetarian Festival in Phuket and Loi Krathong in the north are generally held in the months between September and November. They are based on the lunar calendar and so the dates are not fixed, however you can count on them occurring during this loose time frame. Both are incredible and worth making the effort to see."]
