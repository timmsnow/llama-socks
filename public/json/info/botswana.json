Visas are available on arrival for citizens of countries where a visa is required.", "It may be a good idea to bring your yellow fever certificate here as proof of vaccination. Botswana may require you to show your proof of vaccination if you are coming from any country with a high prevalence of Yellow Fever (countries in the Yellow Fever belt of Africa and South America). The list of countries does change from time to time, so it’s better to bring the card and not need it than be refused entry.\n\nThere is a 10 day incubation period after receiving the vaccination, so validity begins 10 days after you’ve taken the vaccine. Certificates are valid for either 10 years from the time of issue or for life."]

    "section": ["Dry Season", "Wet Season", "February", "Shoulder Season"],
    "texts": ["The dry season runs from the end of May to October and is generally considered to be the best time to visit Botswana. This is mainly due to the fact that animals in the National Parks may be easier to spot due to dry conditions making the watering holes their main lifeline. In the wet season animals are able to get their water from elsewhere and so are less concentrated.\n\nThe grass during the dry season is shorter as well, making it easier to catch a glimpse of any animals that might be lurking in the grass. The weather also tends to be cooler and so more tourists seem to prefer to travel during this time.", "In the wet season, (November-March) it can be extremely hot, and even humid in some parts of the country. “Wet” is a strong word in Botswana as the country is about 80% desert. Rainfall is infrequent even during these months, although flash floods can happen and are something to be aware of when camping as they can be extremely  quick and dangerous. \n\nThis time of year is often referred to as the “green” season, and trees, shrubs, and grasses all grow in abundance. The grass can get pretty high during this time of year which can obscure some of the animals who enjoy spending their time in repose (every cat EVER).\n\nThe best reason to come to Botswana during the green season is because very few other people do. While it’s still a good idea to book in advance, you may find yourself the only one staying at your lodge or campsite. This means cheaper rates and all the fun animal times without having to share!","I traveled in January, which is said to be the “worst time” to see animals in Botswana, and the road conditions are meant to be the worst. Take this with a grain of salt. Some roads will be washed out and muddy, but you can get around this by talking to the park rangers and figuring out the best route to drive. The majority of the driving is of the sandy variety, and rain can make sand-driving actually LESS challenging by compacting the sand.\n\nIf you’re someone like me who relishes the hot weather, this is a wonderful time to go. There are less tourists, and still plenty of wildlife to take in. That being said, expect a torrential downpour or two, and plan accordingly. Make sure there is room in your schedule to wait out a storm if need be.", "Traveling during the shoulder seasons and the off season is a great way to save some money and give yourself some bargaining power. If you do want to travel in the off-season, try to time it before the big rains start, err on the early side like December or early January. Some resorts do close down for the low season so check before arrival. Because less people tend to visit in the low season it may be more difficult to find other travelers to share a 4×4 with, but if you start your trip in Gaborone or Maun, and have time to hang out for a few days you should be able to meet up with people at backpacker hubs like Mokolodi."]

Chances are if you’re overhearing a conversation at the petrol station or in a bar or restaurant, it’s more than likely Setswana that you’re listening to."]
