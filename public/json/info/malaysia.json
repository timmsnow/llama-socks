Islands in the Gulf of Thailand like the Perhentians or Tioman are pretty much inaccessible during this time. Many dive shops and hotels shut down for the monsoon and honestly, even if you could get out there, and someone did agree to take you diving, there wouldn’t be much to see due to bad visibility underwater. Mid March things start to clear up and the islands in the gulf become the paradisiacal islets they were born to be.", "Alternatively the west coast has it’s dry season during the Nov-March months, and experiences monsoon rain from April to Oct. These rains are not as severe as the ones in the east and tend to be intense, but short lived.", "Borneo is a freak that does whatever it wants whenever it wants. While it’s pretty much always a sweltering jungle, Borneo weather is extremely localized and can change constantly. The “wetter” season is from November to Feb, but really, anything can happen here. The high tourist season runs from May to September, and it’s advisable to book ahead during this period."]
