All passengers are required to wear seat belts at all times.", "All signs will be posted in English. You can expect a few cop stops now and then if you’re traveling any considerable distance. Informal roadblocks are usually positioned near highway on/off ramps and are designed to catch drunk drivers. Your vehicle is not subject to search here without a warrant, however, K78 roadblocks are sanctioned by the National Police Commissioner and if they deem you suspect, any cop can search your vehicle legally. With that in mind, as long as you’re obeying the laws and aren’t stashing anything illegal in your car you should have no problems."]

It is a requirement for travelers coming from certain areas, and different countries are added and subtracted from the list every now and then so it’s better to have it and be safe, otherwise you could be denied entry without it. Depending on your port of Entry, proof of onward travel may also be requested. Depending on your luck with the immigration officer, it may not be enough to buy a cheap ticket to a neighboring country in this case, so if at all possible arrange your onward travel or return ticket in advance, as you could be held up at the border until you can supply proper proof. This is generally more of an issue at airports, but it can happen at land border crossings as well, where there is no wifi, and you could be on the next bus back from where you came.
