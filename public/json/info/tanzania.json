It was pretty painless and only took a day and a half. They prefer US dollars, but took my Zambian Kwacha all the same.", "Depending on where you are coming from you may be required to show your Yellow Fever Vaccination card. This is a good thing to have across the board if you are traveling in places like Africa. The certificate is valid for ten years, so get it done and keep it with your passport just in case."]

This is busy-season however, so prepare for EVERYTHING to be more expensive, and crowded.", "December and January are when the calving season takes place so if you’re into baby animals… and I mean really, who isn’t?.. this could be a good time to go.", "March and April mark the peak of the wet season, which mostly affects southern Tanzania. This means some roads become impassable and I HIGHLY recommend you don’t attempt a land-border crossing into Mozambique during this time. It’ll be a mess and you’re likely to spend days to weeks trying to navigate the muddy highways back to civilization. Getting around any un-paved areas is tough during this time of year so keep that in mind if you want to visit in this low-season period. The northern parks are largely unaffected, and you can expect lower prices and fewer peeps."]

You will be hearing a good deal of “give me my t-shirt” and “give me my chicken!”, from village children who are eager to practice their English… and hopefully acquire a chicken while they’re at it…"]
