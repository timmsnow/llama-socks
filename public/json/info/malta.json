If you have an appliance designed to run on 110 V at 60 Hz, (like most standard American appliances) the vast majority will be able to operate just fine using only the European plug adapter.\n\nHowever, double check your appliance as some of them (like hair curlers and hair dryers) will not be able to handle the change in voltage without an actual voltage converter. You should know how your appliance takes electricity before plugging it into a foreign socket to avoid self-destruction.", "The European plug socket is the type F plug.\n\nIt is has two rounded plugs and is typically ungrounded by a third plug."]

If the entire 90 day period is used, the passport/visa holder is required to exit the Schengen area for a period of at least 3 months (90 days) before they are eligible for re-entry. This means no sneaky border runs to renew your visa!\n\nPeople wishing to stay longer in the Schengen zone will have to apply for a student, work, or residency visa which I’m sure is a lot of fun and not a bureaucratic nightmare at all. Uh huh.\n\nThe visa can take the form of an entry stamp in your passport, or a visa page depending on your nationality."]

The islands are the driest during these months, with nary a cloud in the sky and Northern Europeans flock to the beaches in droves in search of a quality tan. Oddly, these months do come with more humidity and, as a result, more bugs. Mozzies can be a real annoyance especially in July and August.", "Tourism in Malta has definitely reached an all time high, and while technically September-October is the “shoulder season”, and one should be able to enjoy the lingering warm weather without the crowds associated with the high season, these days even the shoulder season can feel packed with people. If you aim to get a little off the beaten path however, by spending more time on Gozo, or the quieter sides of Malta, you’ll be able to reclaim some space. Rainfall can be somewhat unpredictable during this time as well, so you can expect a mix of clear and rainy days.", "The BEST months in my opinion for visiting Malta are in spring. During the months of April, May, and even early June, the weather is warm and (mostly) dry, and the tourist machine has yet to really rev its engines.", "The Diving season lasts from May through the end of October. The water temperatures during this time fall on the spectrum between 20-26°.", "In the winter you can expect your visit to be windy and probably a little wet. Prices are sure to be lower during this time of year, and that abysmal traffic a little bit lighter."]
