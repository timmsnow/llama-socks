This means it could be difficult to run certain appliances (like hair-dryers) that you’ve brought with you from home. You may need to use a converter, or buy the appliance in Japan. Most appliances should be ok, however it’s best to check with the manufacturer.", "Japanese electrical plugs and outlets resemble North American ones (two flat pins)."]

There are four consecutive holidays in a row at the end of April and beginning of May and so train tickets and hotels get sold out way in advance. If you’re going to be in Japan during this time, like I was, make some bookings beforehand and reserve your seats on the train.", "Winter means ski-season in Japan, and it does NOT disappoint. Think Colorado-quality powder, hot bowls of ramen between runs, and surprisingly affordable lift tickets. December-March are the best months for skiing, but in the northern-most parts of the country you can still hit the slopes through April. May is a mixed bag and while you may be able to find some snow if you make it all the way to Hokkaido, most ski outfits will be closing down for the summer season."]

This is the alphabet you will encounter the most and the one you will benefit the most from learning.", "Based almost entirely on Chinese characters, Katakana is mostly used for transcribing foreign words into Japanese.", "This is the oldest alphabet in Japan, and is extremely difficult to master. It is not a phonetic language but instead a symbolic one, in which each character represents a different noun, verb, adjective, or idea.", "English is not very commonly spoken, although you will be able to navigate most tourists areas with English alone. It can be helpful to learn a few basic Japanese phrases."]
