This is the same as in most of the neighboring countries, so if you’ve purchased any appliances in Europe or Africa you should be good to go. Most appliances are designed for dual voltage, however some bigger appliances like hair dryers may cause issue if they run on 110 V (like American appliances).", "Egypt uses European style power plugs and sockets. (type C and F)", "Egypt experiences frequent power outages, so charge up when you can. Black outs can last several hours so you ‘ll want to make sure your camera is charged and ready to go."]

Seatbelts must be worn at all times. It is also mandatory to keep a first aid kit in your vehicle in case of emergency. The speed limit is 60 kmph in cities, and 90 kmph on the motorways unless otherwise listed.", "Driving in Egypt is NO JOKE, especially in cities like Cairo. Seriously, it’s QUITE chaotic. Traffic lights are often not in working order, and road rules are not always adhered to. Traffic accidents are more than common, so be alert at all times if you decide to tackle driving here. Parking is a pain, horns get used A LOT, and people are literally everywhere. Be careful. I don’t recommend driving."]

Not only will you protect yourself from any misunderstandings at the border, the visa’s look spiffier, and you can save yourself time when you land."]

Most of the ancient sites will be in areas with very little rain fall. It can be a wearisome time for travelers as temperatures can reach 50 degrees centigrade and the intense summer sun is ever-present.", "I recommend traveling in the shoulder seasons.. (April-May/November-October). You certainly won’t be bundling up from the cold, but you can still expect less crowds at all the sites then in the peak season. Even in May places like the Valley of the Kings and areas with little shade will be extremely hot.\n\nRegardless of when you come, bring lot’s of sun protection and make hydration a priority."]

It can be helpful to learn a few.", "It is relatively easy to navigate the country with English. English is taught in most schools and you can be assured that tour guides and most individuals working in the tourist industry will have some working knowledge of English. And Spanish. And French. And Hungarian. Seriously, they speak everything."]
