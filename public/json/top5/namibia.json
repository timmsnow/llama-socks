Prepare to be overwhelmed by the sheer size of these ancient, rust-colored dunes that comprise the oldest desert in the world. The warped and haggard trees of deadsvlei are like something out of a CS Lewis novel. Get there early. The hot sun is practically poison by noon."

An abandoned mining town in the southern desert region, far away from everything. Surely, this is what an apocalypse would look like. The whole town is being reclaimed by nature, slowly eaten by sand dunes. Freaky, but freaky-beautiful."

Other humans are a rare find in these parts. Instead, you'll be keeping company with the heartiest of free-roaming animals by day, and at night, about a gazillion brilliant shining stars."
