Spending a few days wandering the maze-like cobblestone streets of the Centro Historico and taking in the sweeping Andean views is a great way to acclimatize yourself to the high country."

Despite being a regional capital, Cuenca is the big city that somehow manages to maintain the warmth and accessibility of a small, country town. Built upon ancient Incan ruins, an ever-present mystique seems to hover in the mist above the cobblestones."

Think dinosaur-sized tortoises, equatorial penguins, extremely vocal colonies of sea lions, and schools upon schools of hammerhead sharks. Welcome to Eden my friends."

Some of the best seafod in the country can be found here, and an evening spent exploring Barrio las Peñas and meandering down the Malecón should make for a memorable trip to this seaside metropolis."
