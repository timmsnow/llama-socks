Just off the coast of Ranong, in the north-west corner of the Thai peninsula, this island sits quietly, like a cat on it's haunches, ignoring the mainland and bathing itself in sunlight. If it's tranquility you're after, here, it is tranquility you shall have. Don't forget to pack your hammock."

Just keep an eye out for those packs of wild dogs roaming the streets after dark..."
