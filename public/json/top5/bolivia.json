But La Paz is full of surprises. The positives far outweigh the negatives here and if given a chance, the city will greet you with open arms, not to mention some truly incredible views."

It's magnitude, majesty, and other-worldly atmosphere, along with the thin air of this high-altitude wonder are enough to make any little llama's head spin. Just go. Once you've been, you'll know."

This means the Bolivian amazon is a little more off the beaten track. It's quieter, more remote, and a great option for those wanting to save a few Bolivianos."
