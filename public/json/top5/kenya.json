The big five come out in droves and you can pretty much count on having some extra close encounters with the local wildlife. The sweeping views of the savannah are the cherry on an already visually overloaded ice cream sundae. Welcome to Africa."

This beautiful beach town is the cure for what ails you. Delicious, spicy swahili food, unforgettable views of a pristine white-sand beach, and lots and lots of very cold beer to wash it all down."

The town itself is being turned into a Swahili eco-paradise as more and more locals get involved in the movement. Amazing food, good vibes, and just a lil' skip away from the ancient ruins of Gede. Kilifi is the perfect stop-over for experiencing all the Swahili coast has to offer."

It's not close to the capital, but finding your way there is half the fun, and getting off the beaten track means you don't have to share. Experience on of the best parks in Kenya for a self-drive safari."

The ethereal swirls of turquoise waters juxtaposed against the blinding white sand dunes create a fantasy you will be dreaming about long after you leave. Lamu takes you back to the glory days of the Swahili coast. Think Zanzibar, but without the crowds. Life is beautiful."
