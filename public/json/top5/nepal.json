Despite over-crowding and some pretty poor air quality, Kathmandu provides a delightful first taste of the magic that this country dishes out in droves. Think: imposing buddhist temples, colorful street markets, delectable cuisine, and in the background, an ever-present resonance of the divine."

Days here are spent hiking in the surrounding countryside and taking in the Himalayan views. The nights are cool and quiet and the locals are friendly. It's a perfect respite from time spent in dusty cities."

Jump off a mountain and paraglide over a pristine glacial lake with an incomprable view of the imposing Annapurna mountain range laid out in front of you. Truly unreal."

The whole town is a Unesco World Heritage Site, and spending a few days navigating the labyrinthine streets will have you feeling like you've stepped back in time.

Trek the passes by day and by night swap yak stories with other travelers while you warm up by the fire."
