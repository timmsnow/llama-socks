This park is known for it's large populations of predators, and in particular, a pride of lions known to have developed the unique skill of elephant hunting. These lions live in the 'Savuti' section of the park, and are likely to put on a show if you're lucky enough to find them"

Come prepared and you'll be rewarded with epic animal encounters, unforgettable desert views, and the magic of star-filled African skies. Come unprepared and you might find yourself grappling for the satelite phone and wishing you'd remembered to pack more water"

This is especially true during the rainy season when migrating zebras and wildebeests take over the park, and the low grass makes for easy animal sightings. The Baobabs here are older than dirt and will have you weighing the benefits of tree-house living"

The ancient rock carvings that can be found here are estimated to be from 4,000 to 40,000 years old and tell the tale of the San people and their relationship to the world around them"
