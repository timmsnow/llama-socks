There are also hidden waterfalls, mountain hikes, friendly locals, and lots and lots of hammock time on offer. Perfection."

Get up close and personal with these beauties, enjoy the jungle views from a raft on the river, stuff your face with a bowl of perfectly piquant Rendang, then wash it all down with a cold beer while you watch the Sumatran sunset from the comfort of your tree house accommodation. Jungle life is the best life."

Very few people take the time to make the journey all the way out here, so you know it's gonna be good. Spend a few days, and you'll never look at the color blue the same again."

Diving in the surrounding marine park is an incredible experience, with schools of giant manta rays making regular appearances."
