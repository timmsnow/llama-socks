There is only one flight daily and a ferry once or twice a week, weather permitting, which means this peaceful island isn't on the radar for most travelers, and that's a really really good thing. It's extremely friendly, passionately cared for by the locals, and out-of-this-world beautiful. Bury me on Camiguin."

The mildly traumatic bus ride from Manila, the unapologetically difficult tourism board of Sagada, and then, finally, the breath-taking expanse of the picture-perfect terraces of Banaue. Embark on a multi-day hike or just day trip it."

These islands are the crown glory of Palawan's limestone-karst kingdom, and she is truly a stunner. You'll think your camera is broken, not to mention your eyes, because the whole place is so fantastic it doesn't look real."

Shocking, terrifying, and unforgettable, you can swim through these Japanese behemoths with a flash light and really give yourself something to think about. If you aren't a diver there are neighboring beaches dying to be explored."

It's about as remote as a beach in northern Palawan can get, so if you want to get away from everyone, this is the place. Quiet, stunning, and for now at least, totally empty."
