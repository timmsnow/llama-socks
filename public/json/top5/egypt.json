These icons are the crown jewels of the archeology world, so prepare to be gob-smacked. This is absolutely one of the most special places on the planet. Even if there IS a Pizza Hut right across the road..."

Explore the Black and White deserts with the help of hearty bedouin guides and see the dramatic landscapes of what was once an ancient seabed. Oh, and expect to get upclose and personal with a great deal of sand. Lots and lots, and LOTS of sand."

Swim in the river, visit sparsely populated islands, and access ancient sites directly from your boat just as the ancients did, as you float along the most famous river in the world."

The giant temple complex serves as a testament to the capabilities of the great builders of ancient Egypt. Spending a day here is a must. ...Just resist the urge to for a swim."
