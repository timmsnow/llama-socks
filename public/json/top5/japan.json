Everything is immaculately clean (including the public toilets), and well organized. Despite the cramped spaces, somehow, everything stays in it's place. There's an endless supply of incredible eats, and the shopping is so intrinsically joyful and unique, it's impossible not to partake."

It's extremely well-connected to Tokyo and only takes about an hour to reach by Shinkansen. It's here, in the surrounding mountains that you can visit Japan's famous snow monkeys. Winter is ski season in Nagano. Think: ski, ramen, onsen, sake, repeat."

Despite her age, Tsuru No Yu is elegant, refined, and impeccable looked after. It's wonderfully isolated, and the onsen here is the cure for all that ails you."

Wild horses roaming the hillsides, secluded beaches with crystal clear water, and underneath it all: the enchanting, enigmatic underwater pyramid of Yonaguni."
