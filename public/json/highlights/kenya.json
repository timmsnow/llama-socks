This park is the smallest national park in Kenya, but it still manages to give you some good animal loving. Lion spotting is good here."

It’s a beautiful ride through the Kenyan country-side, and much more comfortable than the arduous bus journey. Spend your time counting scores of red, mud-soaked Elephants as you pass through Tsavo National Park. If you are on the afternoon train, you’ll pass through the park right as the sun goes down. Magical."

One of the first things you notice while stirring your breakfast mango shake is the number of brightly colored, elephantine kites twirling their way across the sparkling calm morning sea. Diana is one of the top kitesurfing destinations in the world. It’s a carnival in nylon and polyester. Definitely give it a try, but dear god wear waterproof sunscreen, or suffer the consequences."

There are excellent accommodation options around and you can actually rent a bicycle to get around most places, including through the park itself. That’s right: BICYCLE SAFARI. ‘Nuff said."
