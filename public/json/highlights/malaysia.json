Although a little harder to get to then their better known cousin, Tioman Island, the isolation of the Perhentians is what makes them so special. This is an excellent place to try scuba diving, as the sea life is abundant and the prices are cheap. Wifi is limited and ATMs are few and far between, they don’t make ’em like this anymore!"

It’s a mountainous beauty and the beaches are picture perfect. There is a wide variety of good food with a night market that moves around the island on a daily basis. The whole island is duty free, if you’re into that kind of thing."

The whole city is dotted with cat statues, murals of cats, and even an impressive (tho not oft visited I think…) Cat Museum… which is an overwhelming display of all things.. CAT. The surrounding area has tons of outdoorsy jungle activities you can partake in including crocodile river cruises and orangutan nature reserves. CAT!"

    "text": "The Thaipussam festival occurs once a year in certain states in Malaysia, most famously in Penang and the Batu Caves, generally lasting for about 2-3 days. Devotees of Murugan (the embodiment of Shiva’s light) pray, fast, and perform elaborate ceremonies for 48 hours in the lead up to the festival. A pilgrimage is then taken along a set route to a final temple where participants can give their offerings (like a pot of milk perhaps) and show their devotion by piercing their tongues or cheeks with skewers or putting hooks through their back. It’s extremely colorful, raucous, and the prettiest display of self-mutilation that I ever did see."
