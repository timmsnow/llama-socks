    "text": "Port Barton is the Philippines answer to quaint backpacker beach town. There’s just enough of a town to give you all the creature comforts (and banana pancakes), you need to keep your batteries charged, and it’s just far enough off the main road to discourage the masses from making the trip. You can kayak to other islands for overnight camping trips and hike to beautiful empty beaches along the mainland. I don’t hate it."

Threshers are the ones with the super long tails and the big ole’ dopey eyes that penetrate straight to your soul. All they wanna to do is say “Hi” and show off a little bit and I for one am HERE FOR IT. Love these guys. The rest of the island is essentially beautiful beaches surrounded by beautiful coral wrapped up in cliff jumping and epic sunsets."

It’s extremely accessible, with easy access from Cebu City, and perfect offshore conditions for both learning to scuba and continuing with your hobby. The Sardine Run gets a special mention here because of the thrilling plague-like masses of sardines that block out the sun as they swirl above, beside, and around you during your dive."

Tourists flock to Bohol for the required selfie in front of the admittedly beautiful hills and then make their way onto somewhere else, leaving picturesque Anda for the few of us determined to get away from the crowds, and it pays us back for our efforts in spades."

While considered to be somewhat of a natural wonder and absolutely worth checking out, the underground river is a bit of a shit show. Take a break from the madness and spend a few days relaxing on the peaceful beaches of Sabang proper. Have a frozie. Lay in a hammock. Then maybe see if you’re up for the tourist shakedown that is the underground river."

While the diving is great, and the beaches are beautiful, expect to pay higher prices as the island is becoming known as an up and coming world-class destination."

It’s kind of a bitch to get to and the tiny beach town is extremely limited when it comes to accommodation options. IF you happen to stay in a homestay within the local village, whatever you do, bring ear plugs and try NOT to go the night before the biggest cock-fight of the year. During my trip to the Philippines there was BEFORE Apo Island, and then there was AFTER Apo island. …I won’t harp on about my trauma, but…. trust me when I say that my world was forever changed. The Diving is incredible tho."
