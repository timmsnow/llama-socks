    "text": "The second most populous city in Cambodia, Battambang has a much less frenetic vibe, and a more cosmopolitan air than the capital. It’s laid back, and blends Cambodian small-town charm with the infrastructure of a big city. The surrounding area has lot’s going on and you can easily spend a few days exploring the various wats and caves that dot the countryside. Phnom Sampeu is where you can visit the killing caves of the Khmer Rouge, a sobering experience. At sunset, prepare yourself for the pageantry as a million and a half bats explode from inside the caves putting on an incredible natural display. The boat ride from Siem Reap can be a great way to catch a glimpse of rural Cambodia."

It’s an impressive site and the views from the cliff top alone are worth the visit. Take note: it is important not to stray from the marked paths as there is a real danger of land-mines in the area. You will be safe if your stay on the paths."
