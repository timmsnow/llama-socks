    "text": "This boat trip is one of those fabled must-do’s for travel hardy backpackers. There are all different types of boats making the journey from Lombok to Flores, and different variations of similar itineraries along the way. Most include all of your meals, make stops at beautiful uninhabited islands, and allow for a trip to visit the king of them all: Komodo Island. These trips have varying lengths and depending on the boat/company you go with you may be able to score a private “luxury” cabin. A little friendly negotiation is fine, but don’t skimp on safety, and maybe go with a bigger boat. There have been enough incidents of boats sinking to warrant some research and caution here."

The skyline is dominated by several volcanoes, and one of which happens to be particularly ummmm, vocal. Hiking to the volcanoes is a rewarding experience, not only for the views, but also for the opportunity to detour at the nearby sulfuric hot springs on the way home."
