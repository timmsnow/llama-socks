While mostly known as a surfing hub, the long, wide beaches offer ample opportunities for relaxation and decompression. Think of Huanchaco as a vacation from your vacation. Nearby are the more than impressive ruins of Chan Chan and the Moche pyramids, which pre-date the Incan empire by about 1,000 years."

The whole city is an architectural wonderland, set against the beautiful backdrop of the Pacific Ocean. There is a cosmopolitan vibe to the place, and an exploding foodie/restaurant scene that’s quickly turning Lima into THE culinary destination in South America, and it does not disappoint."

As the jump off point for trips into the Sacred Valley, Cuzco is ground zero, a place where you can comfortably chart your course, meet other travelers, and eat great food."

Spending a few days here soaking up the sun and taking in the small town vibe will do you wonders if you’re making the long bus journey down from Ecuador."

Situated about 2,400 meters above sea level, the city boasts a historic, Unesco World Heritage Site at it’s center, and comes equipped with some pretty fantastic Andean views. It’s not surprising then, that the big ticket item here is, wait for it…. LLAMA WOOL! That’s right, this place is jam packed with hand-made llama-wool EVERYTHING. From hats to gloves, to sweaters, to… SOCKS. Ladies and gentlemen, get ’em here, get ’em now, get ’em hot off the presses. Your little llama feet will be forever grateful."

It’s also known for being home to the last of the world’s Giant Condors, the largest flying birds on the planet. They come here to ride the thermals that rise from the depths of the canyon and can be seen fully spread-eagle (admittedly not my best pun) from various viewpoints along the hiking trails. The trails that weave through the canyon vary in length and difficulty, but even novice hikers can enjoy a gently paced 2-day jaunt to take in the absurd magnificence of this natural wonder."

The urban complex spans more than 150 acres, and houses a 28 meter high temple. It’s difficult to reach, and very few people take the time to visit the site, making it one of the most unique and least visited archeological sites in Peru."

There are more than a few easily accessible day hikes to explore from your base in the town, as well as multi-day treks for those wanting to GTFO. Peaks, valleys, and stunning topaz lagunas are what’s on offer here. Plan to stay awhile, you’ll absolutely fall in love."
